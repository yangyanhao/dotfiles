2012-08-03 12:58:58	genbattle	but then i need to process any state changes that arise form the ISR
2012-08-03 12:59:15	genbattle	but then I was going to have all of my code running in the ISR, and nothing in my loop()

2012-08-03 12:59:53	genbattle	it seemed sorta wrong to me, so moved the state changes to loop(), does that sound like the right thing to do?

2012-08-03 13:00:30	genbattle	except anything that needs millis() or serial I/O

2012-08-03 13:01:24	genbattle	just seems a bit dangerous, as the array of values i've read in could be added to while i'm in the middle of a state-processing loop
2012-08-03 13:01:45	kline	it is dangerous, thats why its disabled by default
2012-08-03 13:02:13	genbattle	what's disabled by default?
2012-08-03 13:02:19	kline	nested interrupts
2012-08-03 13:02:30	genbattle	oh, yea i wouldn't even try that one anyway
2012-08-03 13:02:41	genbattle	i'm happy just doing state processing in loop()
2012-08-03 13:02:41	kline	you can use both millis() and serial IO, they just dont fire until you exit the interrupt

2012-08-03 15:08:12	Ragnorok	adekto: Nearly anything from the 70's should be doable I'd think.  Pick one.  Having said that I'd also have to say an Arduino was not designed for this sort of thing, so you'll have an uphill slog.  If you want to build a portable game I'd opt for the Cortex based thing dongs linked yesterday.  Arduino is a control system, not a game.

2012-08-13 08:45:47	sanelss	not enough base current
2012-08-13 08:46:16	sanelss	well bannanas!

2012-08-13 08:46:51	sanelss	gah
2012-08-13 08:47:59	sanelss	when you think of it, thats still a lot of current(10mA) to drive a transistor...  eh what can u do

2012-08-13 08:50:24	sanelss	the thing i hate is i have no physical power switch. I tried to find some at local electronics sellers. I need one that's capable of 50-100A
2012-08-13 08:50:27	sanelss	ehe
2012-08-13 08:50:48	IcePic	100A? awesome.
2012-08-13 08:50:53	annatar	100A? Wow, what are you doing?

2012-08-13 08:51:36	annatar	where'd you find a 100A relay?
2012-08-13 08:51:38	sanelss	the brushed motor now only draws around 40A but when i get a brushless later it will draw over 100
2012-08-13 08:52:11	sanelss	well it's a 40A car relay. That's to make/break connection and i just use relays for direction so I can turn the fets off when i make a change
2012-08-13 08:52:15	sanelss	so it won't spark
2012-08-13 08:52:40	sanelss	these fets are $4 a piece and didn't have enough money to buy enough for h bridge xD
2012-08-13 08:54:54	Yotson	sanelss for a brushless motor you need a completely different driver setup anyway.
2012-08-13 08:55:09	sanelss	i know
2012-08-13 08:55:12	sanelss	this is just for now
2012-08-13 08:55:37	sanelss	the brushless motor I want has been out of stock for months and is $60. so till im able to get it im going with this brushed motor
2012-08-13 08:55:46	sanelss	hence why i didn't want to spend too much on it to begin with
2012-08-13 08:57:28	sanelss	ok swapped resistor time to see what happens now xD
2012-08-13 08:58:18	sanelss	im always a bit scared with these lipos... because if there is a short anywhere(like i accidently did early with my MM probe) the surge current can go over 200A! my probe tip was extremly hot when i had done that earlier for just a fraction of second
2012-08-13 08:58:49	sanelss	and if that short becomes a weld, then these lipos will most likely explode

2012-08-13 12:06:23	chimptin	So… I've just been messing around with using a tl082 op-amp to check pH. Unfortunately, it produces negative voltages on my multimeter for anything basic (pH >7.0 which produces 0v). How can I remedy this polarity situation and measure?
2012-08-13 12:06:44	chimptin	measure with the arduino, that is
2012-08-13 12:06:45	pwillard	run a single ended OP amp
2012-08-13 12:06:56	chimptin	get it within that 5v range
2012-08-13 12:07:29	chimptin	I can just put a resistor to get it under 5v, a diode, or w/e
2012-08-13 12:07:48	sanelss	hey pwillard want to see my latest projects? :D
2012-08-13 12:08:04	chimptin	but wtf with getting negative voltages with bases and positive for acids
2012-08-13 12:08:06	pwillard	LM324 for example... or get a rail to rail device, like... TS272
2012-08-13 12:09:07	pwillard	TS272 --> OUTPUT VOLTAGE CAN SWING TO GROUND
2012-08-13 12:09:21	Yotson	chimptin your probe produces negative voltages for bases. Nothing else to do than to get a powersupply that also goes negative. (+5V, gnd and -5V for example)
2012-08-13 12:09:43	pwillard	eww.... did not know that...
2012-08-13 12:11:01	sanelss	you guys are over complicating it i think. if all your inputs are negative then just use an inverting amplifier.
2012-08-13 12:11:03	Yotson	a lot of probes produce around 0V at a ph of 7 (neutral). bases produce negative voltages and acids positive.

2012-08-13 12:12:17	sanelss	depends how you have it setup. you can setup a voltage devider on the op amp to compress the input. within range
2012-08-13 12:12:49	sanelss	though if you probe needs bigger rail then you supply it, you won't get proper functionality

2012-08-13 12:14:04	Yotson	and nope, you need the dc voltage of the probe. ac coupling won't work.

2012-08-13 12:15:26	sanelss	if you have 5V and 0V. then a simply devider would give you a reference of 2.5V and -2.5V from that reference

2012-08-13 12:19:21	bexxx	how mch $
2012-08-13 12:20:09	Deskwizard	cjdavies: accuracy is limited on consumer device, if you need an antenna, look at the holux gr-87

2012-08-13 15:18:31	cjdavies	Maybe a silly question, but I'm reading about a GPS receiver that says it only runs on 3.3v so you need some sort of level conversion to use it with an arduino - but the arduino has 3.3v output... is it referring to the logic/digital connections rather than the power?

2012-08-13 15:26:37	cjdavies	it's made specifically for arduino, so I'm guessing that the lack of current doesn't cause it to fall over

2012-08-13 15:33:47	pwillard	 50mA is the limit if you have the FTDI chip... it's actually higher if you have an UNO
2012-08-13 15:34:36	cjdavies	I do have an Uno :)
2012-08-13 15:35:02	pwillard	The 3.3V actually came from a pin on the FTDI USB/SERIAL IC.  The UNO has a discrete 3.3V power regulator.
2012-08-13 15:35:28	cjdavies	ah I see - is the FTDI replaced by the atmega16u2 on Uno R3?
2012-08-13 15:35:49	pwillard	yes... so no built in 3.3V supply anymore... a regulator was added
2012-08-13 15:36:23	Yotson	http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno still mentions 50mA... But yeah, at least your not nuking the serial bridge.

2012-08-13 16:18:48	cjdavies	tobiasBora: I've actually recently done some C++ serial arduino stuff, I found this incredibly helpful - http://www.webalice.it/fede.tft/serial_port/serial_port.html
2012-08-13 16:20:08	cjdavies	tobiasBora: if your code only works when the serial monitor in the IDE is active, it may well be a permissions issue - eg your code doesn't have permissions to open the serial port, but can read from it if if has already been opened by the IDE
2012-08-13 16:21:31	tobiasBora	cjdavies: but then, why I've not any error when I try to open the serial port ?
2012-08-13 16:21:46	tobiasBora	and thanks for the link, I'm reading.
2012-08-13 16:21:56	cjdavies	what library are you using to access the port? boost?
2012-08-13 16:22:02	tobiasBora	And moreover, it works in python...
2012-08-13 16:23:05	tobiasBora	I don't use any library : I tried "echo -n '1' > /etc/ttyACM0", and after I tried code like this one :

2012-08-13 16:24:03	cjdavies	ah, yes, I started reading that guide as well a few weeks ago...
2012-08-13 16:24:15	cjdavies	then I decided to let boost handle all of the low level stuff for me :)
2012-08-13 16:24:19	cjdavies	more overhead, of course

2012-08-13 18:10:08	pwillard	actually, Slave Select is ACTIVE LOW
2012-08-13 18:10:27	pwillard	sometimes called CHIP SELECT, by the way
2012-08-13 18:11:02	TLoFP-NIX1	so if the chip select is on HIGH that means it is NOT active?
2012-08-13 18:11:41	pwillard	right... it is common tp use a pullup resistor to perform that task

2012-08-13 18:12:24	pwillard	so you will often see the ss pin with a 4.7K or 10K resistor to the 5V supply

2012-08-14 09:54:32	Xark	gordonjcp: This was for another MCU.  However, I have AVRs at many speeds (several with "sockets" for crystals since I keep switching what I want). :)

2012-08-14 10:06:21	Xark	gordonjcp: Yes.  So you need to use the right inductor to "pull out" the higher harmonic (or something to that effect).  I just ordered another crystal (slightly more expensive).  I think over 40Mhz or so none are fundamental.

2012-08-14 10:19:23	Xark	gordonjcp: For 50Mhz, where there is no fundamental crystal available, I just ordered a little oscillator circuit (small rectangular thing).
