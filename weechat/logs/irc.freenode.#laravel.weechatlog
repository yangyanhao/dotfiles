2012-07-25 10:13:02	ShawnMcCool	most recent post could be handled with $this->has_one()
2012-07-25 10:13:12	ShawnMcCool	and could be eager loaded along with the rest
2012-07-25 10:13:22	ShawnMcCool	so that right there is umm, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 queries
2012-07-25 10:13:33	ShawnMcCool	and they're simple queries, and the query count won't ever need to increase
2012-07-25 10:13:44	ShawnMcCool	you can use mysql query cache as well
2012-07-25 10:14:05	ShawnMcCool	to make it more performant, you can have a posts column (last_response_id) or something
2012-07-25 10:14:13	ENQ	ShawnMcCool, i dont think using has_one will join on most recent record
2012-07-25 10:14:28	ShawnMcCool	you'd just chain order_by, enq

2012-07-25 10:15:26	sijdesign	ShawnMcCool: ENQ what i have now is that it should select * from forumthread table and forumcomments table
2012-07-25 10:15:51	ShawnMcCool	if i were you i'd try to avoid complex queries, hand-written sql queries, etc
2012-07-25 10:15:57	ShawnMcCool	and opt for small and simple, easily cached queries
2012-07-25 10:16:02	ShawnMcCool	and to use eloquent for all it's worth
2012-07-25 10:16:35	sijdesign	ShawnMcCool: thats what im trying to, but it should be simple just to show forum posts

2012-07-25 13:06:15	ShawnMcCool	then you'd call that before validating
2012-07-25 13:06:35	ShawnMcCool	any way you want to solve that problem should be ok though, the model can work in any way that it needs to

2012-07-25 13:15:12	ShawnMcCool	put your authentication filter into the constructor of your admin controller base class, then create an admin authentication controller and make it not extend the base class
2012-07-25 13:16:44	th3d0g	ok - cool - the syntax for the auth filter would be... $this->filter('before', 'auth')->except(array('login'));

2012-07-25 14:26:01	ShawnMcCool	may i ask what the 'd' in dberry stands for?
2012-07-25 14:27:12	ShawnMcCool	nickstr: i had no idea how often i intermingled dutch in my communications with my family until my mother visited
2012-07-25 14:27:26	nickstr	Haha, is it that bad? :D

2012-07-25 14:29:34	nickstr	I have it the other way around shawn, often enough i don't know the dutch word for something so i just use the english one ;)
2012-07-25 14:29:36	ShawnMcCool	machuga: i think i'm taking the plunge with linode, i've talked to people with over a year of uptime, and the stackscripts are great

2012-07-25 14:30:18	ShawnMcCool	1 full week without programming, may be the first time since i was 10
2012-07-25 14:30:40	machuga	\o/
2012-07-25 14:30:42	machuga	Feeling refreshed?
2012-07-25 14:30:45	xsbeats|mobile	I'm sure u sketched some UML ShawnMcCool
2012-07-25 14:30:59	ShawnMcCool	actually right now i'm feeling like work is hard to get back into
2012-07-25 14:31:25	ShawnMcCool	but yes, i was coding around the clock before i went on vacation
2012-07-25 14:31:36	ShawnMcCool	so, i've just been doing administrivia getting things lined up, and have been doing some light coding today
2012-07-25 14:31:42	ShawnMcCool	mostly server stuff and administrivia though
2012-07-25 14:31:50	machuga	Right.  Very understandable though.
2012-07-25 14:31:53	ShawnMcCool	i'm going to adopt nginx now, to get the experience
2012-07-25 14:32:05	machuga	fun fun
2012-07-25 14:32:08	ShawnMcCool	and justin and i are changing the way we do business now
2012-07-25 14:32:19	machuga	using it as the full server or just as a reverse proxy
2012-07-25 14:32:24	machuga	Oh ya?
2012-07-25 14:32:39	xsbeats|mobile	ShawnMcCool: How is it working with someone in a diff country?
2012-07-25 14:32:42	ShawnMcCool	yea, basically, we haven't landed the clients that can afford to pay us what we should be making
2012-07-25 14:32:50	ShawnMcCool	that's getting a bit better recently
2012-07-25 14:33:09	xsbeats|mobile	Different continent actually lol
2012-07-25 14:33:19	ShawnMcCool	in the past we say yea... this site will cost liek 26k
2012-07-25 14:33:27	ShawnMcCool	and if the client comes abck and says, that's too much, what can we do for 18k
2012-07-25 14:33:41	ShawnMcCool	we work hard to cut down the features and just fit SOMETHING into that budget
2012-07-25 14:33:50	ShawnMcCool	now we're basically just going to say, sorry
2012-07-25 14:34:00	ShawnMcCool	and focus all of our non-client time on our own stuff
2012-07-25 14:34:16	machuga	right.  That's a pretty good plan
2012-07-25 14:34:23	ShawnMcCool	it's a risk
2012-07-25 14:34:27	ShawnMcCool	but, fuck it
2012-07-25 14:34:27	machuga	very much so
2012-07-25 14:34:39	machuga	but like you said - the current plan isn't doing what you'd like
2012-07-25 14:34:43	machuga	so a risk is needed
2012-07-25 14:34:47	ShawnMcCool	exactly.. and his wife works, and i have savings
2012-07-25 14:34:53	ShawnMcCool	so, we have some room to play
2012-07-25 14:35:29	xsbeats|mobile	Think it'll be tough to say no?
2012-07-25 14:35:30	machuga	definitely good
2012-07-25 14:35:58	machuga	With the way some things are transpiring here at the office I'm considering moving to just working for myself within the next several months
2012-07-25 14:36:12	machuga	So I'm very interested in hearing how the plan unfolds
2012-07-25 14:36:16	<--	Elabor (~Elabor@91.142.172.73) has quit (Quit: KVIrc 4.0.4 Insomnia http://www.kvirc.net/)
2012-07-25 14:37:03	ShawnMcCool	xsbeats_: yes, i think it'll be tough to say no
2012-07-25 14:37:09	xsbeats|mobile	U r my hero machuga
2012-07-25 14:37:18	ShawnMcCool	also, yea it's actually sort of tough for us to work apart, the ONLY problem being the time zone
2012-07-25 14:37:40	ShawnMcCool	justin has actually adapted his schedule so that he wakes up and starts working at 6am
2012-07-25 14:37:56	ShawnMcCool	in this way, we have about 4 hours of work time together per day
2012-07-25 14:38:01	machuga	well that's definitely helpful
2012-07-25 14:38:04	ShawnMcCool	so that we can be doing work side-by-side
2012-07-25 14:38:06	machuga	xsbeats|mobile: haha why?
2012-07-25 14:38:07	xsbeats|mobile	ShawnMcCool: yeah that's gotta be difficult.  I am 3 hours behind all my coworkers and that sucks.  I'm sure ur diff is much worse
2012-07-25 14:38:21	ShawnMcCool	he's also doing it so that he can end his work day earlier
2012-07-25 14:38:23	xsbeats|mobile	machuga: I want to quit and work for myself
2012-07-25 14:38:35	nickstr	Then do it ;)
2012-07-25 14:38:51	xsbeats|mobile	Kids, health insurance life insurance
2012-07-25 14:38:54	ShawnMcCool	find a part-time job xsbeats_, then work for yourself on the side
2012-07-25 14:39:01	machuga	xsbeats|mobile: start lining things up so you can do it within a reasonable amount of time
2012-07-25 14:39:07	machuga	I'm definitely not just jumping into it
2012-07-25 14:39:31	machuga	I'm starting on smaller projects again, then putting my name in with the local firms who are familiar with me and letting them know I'm taking clients again
2012-07-25 14:39:31	xsbeats|mobile	Yeah I definitely need to increase my savings before I do anything
2012-07-25 14:39:44	nickstr	You do need your savings
2012-07-25 14:39:50	nickstr	you'll eat them up so fast
2012-07-25 14:39:52	nickstr	its not even funny
2012-07-25 14:39:52	machuga	Then once it gets overwhelming I'll have to leave my job or leave my clients
2012-07-25 14:40:13	nickstr	Last time i had spare money on the bank was 2 years ago ;)

2012-07-25 14:45:12	machuga	Did you notice if it's running cooler than it was in lion?
2012-07-25 14:45:23	machuga	Oh - I have native PHP so I think it might blow it away
2012-07-25 14:45:24	Tobsn	oh yeah
2012-07-25 14:45:30	Tobsn	everything just seems more orderly
2012-07-25 14:45:35	machuga	Leopard -> Snow Leopard blew it away, SL to Lion blew it away
2012-07-25 14:45:46	Tobsn	native php?

2012-07-25 14:45:57	xsbeats|mobile	Damn I wish I had my mbp right now
2012-07-25 14:46:03	Tobsn	yeah you might want to recompile
2012-07-25 14:46:22	machuga	Well that's what I mean - their version will install their new version
2012-07-25 14:46:27	Tobsn	yep
2012-07-25 14:46:34	machuga	But ya, if it's not 5.4 I'll just recompile this one
2012-07-25 14:46:46	ShawnMcCool	man, this totally shitty unity3d platformer made it into the indie royale indie bundle
2012-07-25 14:46:50	Tobsn	$ php -v

2012-07-25 14:47:00	Jorijn	Tobsn: do you run macports?
2012-07-25 14:47:08	ShawnMcCool	and i downloaded it and played it, and tested the way it handled various 'trouble' conditions that i've identified with the engine
2012-07-25 14:47:10	Tobsn	homebrew
2012-07-25 14:47:12	machuga	Jorijn: noooo abandon macports!
2012-07-25 14:47:13	Tobsn	but havent tried yet
2012-07-25 14:47:13	xsbeats|mobile	Brew!!
2012-07-25 14:47:20	ShawnMcCool	and in every situation, my punchgirl code handles the situations better. i feel good
2012-07-25 14:47:22	machuga	Breeeeeeeeeeeeewwwww
2012-07-25 14:47:23	Tobsn	yeah i never used macports
2012-07-25 14:47:32	machuga	Macports was a bit of a wanker
2012-07-25 14:47:34	Tobsn	i just brew it
2012-07-25 14:47:51	Jorijn	machuga: ..no, brew forces you to use the native installed php, which sucks balls
2012-07-25 14:47:51	Tobsn	machuga, yeah you probably need to recompile it
2012-07-25 14:48:04	Jorijn	I couldn't even install a few php modules :/
2012-07-25 14:48:10	machuga	Jorijn: what part of it forces?
2012-07-25 14:48:16	Tobsn	i use mamp... all in one folder, i like that
2012-07-25 14:48:18	machuga	I got php 5.4 from brew
2012-07-25 14:48:37	Jorijn	probably the part where I don't have time to find out how everything works and macports just always does the job
2012-07-25 14:48:53	Tobsn	wait, how do you install 5.4 with brew?
2012-07-25 14:48:57	machuga	Heh, getting a bit defensive, mate.  No need to stress
2012-07-25 14:49:13	machuga	Tobsn: I found a tutorial - someone has a repo.  let me check brew to see if I can grab it for you
2012-07-25 14:49:23	ShawnMcCool	yo Jorijn, how's life?
2012-07-25 14:49:24	Tobsn	i see that there is php54 on brew
2012-07-25 14:49:37	ShawnMcCool	we should get another get-together going some time in August.

2012-07-25 16:10:04	Meztek	yeah thats what i meant
2012-07-25 16:10:06	ShawnMcCool	PascalCase plus underscores for controllers

2012-07-25 16:10:19	qwebirc94694	How?

2012-07-25 16:11:04	Tobsn	because its not yet released

2012-07-25 16:13:05	sdeinum	because homebrew complained a bit, or some of the recipes did

2012-07-25 16:13:18	sdeinum	what
2012-07-25 16:13:21	sdeinum	whats wrong with RVM
2012-07-25 16:13:26	JesseObrien	recipes, gems, brewing
2012-07-25 16:13:28	JesseObrien	cookin' meth?
2012-07-25 16:13:31	CSmith	What's the difference between Controllers and Models?
2012-07-25 16:13:39	sdeinum	Ruby programmers and meth dealers are kind of similiar
2012-07-25 16:13:45	xsbeats|mobile	JesseObrien: Breaking Mac
2012-07-25 16:14:04	ShawnMcCool	controllers manage application flow and tie together models and views
2012-07-25 16:14:35	ShawnMcCool	models are simplified representations, generally used to describe interactions with a data source such as database or api interactions
2012-07-25 16:15:04	ShawnMcCool	for example, often you'd have a library that handles low level interactions with an api. then you'd have a model that abstracted interactions with the api further to be more digestible by your application
2012-07-25 16:15:43	CSmith	So does all the decision making go into the Controllers?
2012-07-25 16:15:57	sdeinum	CSmith: no
2012-07-25 16:16:23	Tobsn	http://fastlz.org/benchmarks.htm
2012-07-25 16:16:33	sdeinum	most of the logic will go in the model
2012-07-25 16:16:38	Xsecrets	oh boy here we go with the debate.
2012-07-25 16:16:40	sdeinum	controllers should follow "tell don't ask" for the most part
2012-07-25 16:16:50	ShawnMcCool	CSmith: it really depends on what you mean by that
2012-07-25 16:16:51	sdeinum	Xsecrets: yeah after this im going to start preaching about vim just hold on
2012-07-25 16:16:53	JesseObrien	CSmith: you want any data manipulation to be done in the model
2012-07-25 16:16:59	JesseObrien	so it spits out exactly what you need
2012-07-25 16:16:59	xsbeats|mobile	If I store and reuse a few instances of a class instead of just one...is that still singleton or is it called something else

2012-07-25 16:17:32	Xsecrets	Depends on who you ask and how they like to program. the initial MVC design was all logic went in the controller. Now days lots of people like light controllers and want to put all the logic in the model.
2012-07-25 16:17:32	sdeinum	but you know
2012-07-25 16:17:37	JesseObrien	xsbeats|mobile: YEAH

2012-07-25 16:17:39	JesseObrien	woo capslock

2012-07-25 16:17:54	ShawnMcCool	all logic into the controller?
2012-07-25 16:17:57	JesseObrien	you use a key to track them
2012-07-25 16:17:59	ShawnMcCool	you guys are just going to confuse him

2012-07-25 18:13:31	sdeinum	the array has the controllers returned in it but they are never routed to properly
2012-07-25 18:13:46	sdeinum	works fine on our workstations using php 5.4 but our dev server is running debian so
2012-07-25 18:13:48	ENQ	sdeinum, i dont use Controller::detect
2012-07-25 18:13:49	Gent	Kindari: it means it runs in a lot of areas where people rely on it
2012-07-25 18:14:05	sdeinum	the debian php version is a lot older... i guess its probably due to that but im not sure why
2012-07-25 18:14:08	lavaeagle	I don't use Controller::detect either

2012-07-25 18:42:46	kbanman	Gent: I get that trolling is enjoyable in that it scratches some engrained itch for attention and self-validation, but you're really not being helpful to the laravel framework or community in any way. Just go away.

2012-07-25 22:36:57	Kindari	its a bug. sorta. I mean its being told to do that, which is right, but on json requests it should be told not to show.
2012-07-25 22:37:28	Jakobud	hmmmm okay, is there a basic work-around for this? Also is this a known/reported bug?
2012-07-25 22:39:13	Jakobud	hmmm it appears that the profiler stuff doesn't show up when I look at the data returned with jQuery
2012-07-25 22:39:17	Jakobud	I guess I can ignore it for now

2012-07-25 22:44:04	atno	if !Request::ajax

2012-07-25 22:45:44	Kindari	I love how little there is in app/start.php and how much power and flexibility that little bit of stuff controls.
2012-07-25 22:46:26	Jakobud	too bad there isn't a Profiler::detach() method so you could manually turn it off
2012-07-25 22:47:07	Kindari	kinda destructive but there is Event::clear('laravel.done') :P
2012-07-25 22:47:47	Jakobud	would that clear everything that is listening for laravel.done?
2012-07-25 22:48:01	Kindari	Yeah, thus why I said its destructive :/
2012-07-25 22:48:16	Jakobud	hmmm too bad there isn't a way to selectively remove just the profiler stuff

2012-07-25 23:01:37	atno	that's cartalyst Kindari is talking about
2012-07-25 23:01:51	Hereisanotherlie	thanks everyone
2012-07-25 23:01:52	atno	PongoCMS
2012-07-25 23:02:04	Xsecrets	I would say pongo is probably more complete than platform. Haven't tried layla since I really don't like using bash scripts to install.
2012-07-25 23:02:12	Kindari	also getlayla.com (thanks atno was trying to get the link)
2012-07-25 23:02:53	atno	Xsecrets: i believe platform is more complete than pongocms
2012-07-25 23:03:05	Kindari	its not required, Xsecrets, and I dont like to either, but it does make it easier.
2012-07-25 23:03:08	atno	pongocms is still in alpha 0.1
2012-07-25 23:03:29	Xsecrets	I wouldn't say that. There is nothing there other than an admin interface and users, and every update breaks more existing stuff without adding anything new.
2012-07-25 23:04:17	atno	Xsecrets: it's a bootstrap, i dont know anything about the upgrades
2012-07-25 23:05:07	Xsecrets	I understand that, but there are no upgrades currently, and the bootstrap portion doesn't work at least with last nights git pull. not sure if anything was done today.

2012-07-25 23:08:26	Xsecrets	I was actually very excited for cartalyst, but then they decided to do platform make cartalyst paid and every time I pull platform there are more problems than the last time, so my excitement is definitely waining.

2012-07-25 23:11:05	Hereisanotherlie	I'm probably mistaken though
2012-07-25 23:11:12	Xsecrets	I don't mind paid layers. I didn't have a problem when they said cartalyst would be free with advanced stuff paid, but now the base commerce is going to be paid and I personally don't really mind that, but I know they will never get the mindshare of something like magenta with that model which sucks since I would love to see a good alternative to that honking POS.

2012-07-25 23:56:48	Tobsn	about how dumb the sport is... he said its all super simple there are just a lot of rules
2012-07-25 23:56:54	Tobsn	the whole game is complete nonsense
2012-07-25 23:57:12	Tobsn	so as argument that it is stupid i said that if it would be so great, why is no other nation playing it
2012-07-25 23:57:38	Tobsn	nike, puma etc. would have a HUGE interest to infect other countries and would enforce that the sport gets popular
2012-07-25 23:57:59	Tobsn	if that hasnt happened yet or was probably tried and failed that would proof that football blows.

2012-07-26 12:45:42	geoid	all is clearly not well
2012-07-26 12:46:02	geoid	if I navigate to my application folder, I get a normal HTML index return showing me the folder contents.
2012-07-26 12:46:02	@JasonLewis	G'day! :)
2012-07-26 12:46:19	ShawnMcCool	you shouldn't be able to navigate to your application folder
2012-07-26 12:46:26	ShawnMcCool	your public/ folder should be configured as your documentroot
2012-07-26 12:46:29	ShawnMcCool	JasonLewis: good day
2012-07-26 12:46:37	geoid	laravel doc says: "Navigate to your application in a web browser."
2012-07-26 12:46:45	ShawnMcCool	yea like
2012-07-26 12:46:53	ShawnMcCool	http://whatever.dev or http://whatever.local
2012-07-26 12:46:57	ShawnMcCool	whatever you set up
2012-07-26 12:47:20	ShawnMcCool	so, you set up a host nam in your hosts file, whatever.local is what i use
2012-07-26 12:47:33	geoid	but but, what if I'm not using vhosts.. just putting it in a folder in my doc root? Like http://localhost/test-dev/laravel/
2012-07-26 12:47:33	ShawnMcCool	then you set up a virtualhost with servername whatever.local and documentroot laravelinstallationfolder/public/
2012-07-26 12:47:46	ShawnMcCool	then i guess you go to laravel/public/index.php
2012-07-26 12:47:50	geoid	ok
2012-07-26 12:47:54	ShawnMcCool	there's a guide on the forums about that
2012-07-26 12:48:31	ShawnMcCool	but, i think that setting up individual domains / vhosts on a dev envirnoment is a better way to go

2012-07-26 12:49:18	@JasonLewis	that's dedication
2012-07-26 12:49:21	geoid	.. and a few months older
2012-07-26 12:49:34	ShawnMcCool	i guess, i read all of the angularjs google groups posts
2012-07-26 12:49:40	ShawnMcCool	i mark them as read when i'm done
2012-07-26 12:49:46	ShawnMcCool	and it keeps track of what's new when ic ome back, etc
2012-07-26 12:49:50	ShawnMcCool	it's not that big a deal
2012-07-26 12:49:50	geoid	I usually come ask ShawnMcCool :D
2012-07-26 12:50:12	ShawnMcCool	but, once i get a good grasp on something, i don't do that anymore
2012-07-26 12:50:51	ShawnMcCool	it's just hard to rely on others to gain technology knowledge without seriously stunting your knowledge gain
2012-07-26 12:51:08	ShawnMcCool	or at least, that's been my experience
2012-07-26 12:51:40	ShawnMcCool	generally people don't respond to questions of any complexity
2012-07-26 12:51:47	geoid	works if your brain can store and sort all that information.. mine saves info in .jpg progressive format.
2012-07-26 12:52:00	ShawnMcCool	and worst case scenario they give just plain bad advice
2012-07-26 12:52:12	ShawnMcCool	it's also not a quick process, it's just quicker than not doing it

2012-07-26 12:57:27	geoid	too fisher-price for me
2012-07-26 12:58:30	geoid	OS Lyin' and IE "nein!" - my 2 pet hates.
2012-07-26 12:59:05	ShawnMcCool	i guess my only major pet peeve is people hating on windows
2012-07-26 12:59:16	ShawnMcCool	because it's always born out of ignorance of the product
2012-07-26 12:59:28	ShawnMcCool	granted, it's perfectly acceptable not to care about a product and not to care about understanding it
2012-07-26 12:59:44	ShawnMcCool	but, when one has strong opinions about something that they intentionally never bothered learning
2012-07-26 12:59:48	ShawnMcCool	it's sort of frustrating
2012-07-26 13:00:01	geoid	not always.. sometimes it's bourne out of long experience with the product
2012-07-26 13:00:19	ShawnMcCool	people say that, but then repeatedly prove to me that they actually don't know much about it
2012-07-26 13:00:33	ShawnMcCool	so, at this point, until people prove to me otherwise, i feel safe in assuming that they simply haven't bothered
2012-07-26 13:01:37	geoid	Well I used Windows from 1992 till 2003 when I switched to Mac. The only thing I miss is the ability to tile windows.
2012-07-26 13:01:52	nickstr	"tile windows' ?
2012-07-26 13:01:56	ShawnMcCool	people in here are always talking about their window tiling solutions
2012-07-26 13:02:02	ShawnMcCool	automatic tiling systems, etc
2012-07-26 13:02:42	geoid	Shouldn't need 'em, should be a built in OS thing, not some clunky add on that will break in the next security update.
2012-07-26 13:02:50	ShawnMcCool	oh, a "should man"
2012-07-26 13:03:01	geoid	lol – what does that mean?
2012-07-26 13:03:01	ShawnMcCool	we have enough of that mentality around here already =)
2012-07-26 13:03:12	ShawnMcCool	people saying that they shouldn't have to do anything, it should all already be done for them
2012-07-26 13:03:24	ShawnMcCool	despite calling themselves programmers =)
2012-07-26 13:03:41	ShawnMcCool	you should see the kinds of things people say in here
2012-07-26 13:03:41	geoid	Nah – I'm just saying that's the only thing that Windows had on Mac imho.
2012-07-26 13:04:10	ShawnMcCool	it generally reveals that they 'should' learn more about how open-source projects work, and that they 'should' learn something or another about business
2012-07-26 13:04:17	ShawnMcCool	it's crazy, so don't take it personally if i rant
2012-07-26 13:04:23	ShawnMcCool	it's just crap that we have to deal with regularly

2012-07-26 13:07:37	ShawnMcCool	but, i don't buy it
2012-07-26 13:07:42	ShawnMcCool	to me, a smart developer is a good developer
2012-07-26 13:07:58	geoid	depends on whether said developer is st00pid/lazy or sm2rt/lazy
2012-07-26 13:08:19	ShawnMcCool	automating systems is smart and more difficult than doing it by hand, until you're done
2012-07-26 13:08:20	nicholasruunu	I know people who work like crazy, but they write shit code. Nothing is DRY.
2012-07-26 13:08:32	ShawnMcCool	that's because they're not programming smart
2012-07-26 13:08:38	geoid	those are called C# developers :p
2012-07-26 13:08:44	ShawnMcCool	c# is a great language
2012-07-26 13:08:51	geoid	can't do DRY in .NET tho
2012-07-26 13:08:56	nicholasruunu	But if they were a bit more lazy they'd think more about how they can do less. :)
2012-07-26 13:09:36	ShawnMcCool	yea, that's just purposely confusing the term lazy in order to support a quote that isn't actually clever
2012-07-26 13:09:59	nicholasruunu	Maybe.
2012-07-26 13:10:07	ShawnMcCool	anyway, back to work i go

2012-07-26 15:33:41	jswart	This is for ShawnMcCool. Saw your forum post: curious why you chose AngularJS over other options.
2012-07-26 15:34:02	ShawnMcCool	i like the way it works
2012-07-26 15:34:10	ShawnMcCool	it has this ...
2012-07-26 15:34:16	ShawnMcCool	spreadsheet formula thing going on
2012-07-26 15:34:26	ShawnMcCool	where you declare data binding with directives
2012-07-26 15:34:39	ShawnMcCool	and the only time you ever directly interact with elements is in the directive definitions
2012-07-26 15:34:50	ShawnMcCool	once you create any custom directives that you may need, you don't have to bind to elements or do anything like that
2012-07-26 15:34:54	ShawnMcCool	the amount of code necessary is tiny
2012-07-26 15:35:07	nickstr	Im trying it out again
2012-07-26 15:36:30	jswart	Interesting.  I'm not super familiar with it. It uses JS to template correct?
2012-07-26 15:36:42	jswart	How does this effect search engines?

2012-07-26 15:37:51	dsyme	morning
2012-07-26 15:38:06	jswart	But with a PHP framework we may have to be more creative.
2012-07-26 15:38:14	ShawnMcCool	single-page ajax sites are generally not great for SEO content
2012-07-26 15:38:23	ShawnMcCool	so if your site is a lot of public searchable stuff
2012-07-26 15:38:31	JesseObrien	SEO is becoming less and less relavent though
2012-07-26 15:38:32	ShawnMcCool	you'd probably not use a JavaScript client interface
2012-07-26 15:38:42	ShawnMcCool	however
2012-07-26 15:38:47	ShawnMcCool	you CAN do it, you just need to develop the architecture for it
2012-07-26 15:38:59	dsyme	anyone awesome at regular expressions. I need to do a find and replace in st2 on <option value="44"> where the value is always diffrent.
2012-07-26 15:39:10	ShawnMcCool	i do not believe that AngularJS or single-page apps in general are right for all applications
2012-07-26 15:39:23	ShawnMcCool	i think that you have to choose the technology that gives you app as many edges as it can get
2012-07-26 15:39:40	jswart	sure. the goal of angularJS is to reduce the mass of ajax and jQuery sprawling around, or is there a different goal?
2012-07-26 15:39:42	ShawnMcCool	https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started
2012-07-26 15:40:04	jswart	yeah, I have seen that shawn. Someone just showed it to me. Need to look at it further.
2012-07-26 15:40:08	ShawnMcCool	the goal of angularjs is to provide a simple interface for creating testable and robust single-page ajax apps as quickly and easily as possible
2012-07-26 15:40:17	dsyme	I personally believe ajax should always only be used for crud and media type stuff.

2012-07-26 15:40:42	ShawnMcCool	i believe that poorly developed ajax sites are bad

2012-07-26 15:45:53	jswart	Yea, and apparently you dont need to escape "<" or ">"

2012-07-26 15:46:47	ShawnMcCool	well, I've been into Ruby for a long time

2012-07-26 16:21:15	Jakobud	yeah normally I would, but if I return a key value array that I need to use to populate an HTML select form field, the json data has no sorting to it. It just uses the keys to sort automatically. But I need the select options to be sorted by value. I'm just looking to avoid more javascript.
2012-07-26 16:22:54	Jakobud	also I'm just curious about the Response::eloquent() method and when you would use that.

2012-07-26 16:43:57	JesseObrien	er, maintain them as in not have them deleted?
2012-07-26 16:45:02	Jakobud	like my original array is { 345: world, 567: hello } and after .sort() my array is { 0: hello, 1: world } instead of { 567: hello, 345: world }
2012-07-26 16:46:01	JesseObrien	did you push the keys back into the array?
2012-07-26 16:46:16	JesseObrien	my_array.push([key, value])
2012-07-26 16:46:29	JesseObrien	push them in in a pair, then youc an use them properly
2012-07-26 16:46:48	Jakobud	no I just did array[key] = value;
2012-07-26 16:46:52	Jakobud	I'll try that
2012-07-26 16:47:59	Jakobud	hmmm did you mean to have that [] in there?

2012-07-26 18:19:13	ShawnMcCoo1	if you put a config file in application/config it could be something like... application/config/videos.php
2012-07-26 18:19:25	ShawnMcCoo1	then if your config option is 'per_page' => 10
2012-07-26 18:19:32	ShawnMcCoo1	you could access that value with Config::get( 'videos.per_page' )
2012-07-26 18:19:42	frogprince_mac	thanks

2012-07-26 19:51:29	Xsecrets	artisan is used to run migrations if that is what you are talking about. Check out the docs. What artisan does not do by default is very much code generation, but there is a bundle called bob which does some code generation.

2012-07-26 20:08:51	ArtificialEX	is class="markdown" all I'm supposed to do?
2012-07-26 20:09:05	ShawnMcCoo2	from the docs: php artisan route:call get api/user/1
2012-07-26 20:09:07	ShawnMcCoo2	http://laravel.com/docs/artisan/commands
2012-07-26 20:09:07	ENQ	idk ArtificialEX dont have that bundle :)
2012-07-26 20:09:14	ericshell	i  have a config file for other configs that i change a  lot for dev/production. just wanna simplify so i dont forget to change something

2012-07-26 20:09:23	oneseventeen	ShawnMcCoo2: thanks! works great!
2012-07-26 20:09:26	ShawnMcCoo2	when actions are involved, the convention is always controller@action
2012-07-26 20:09:32	oneseventeen	I imagine this is the best way to do this rather than doing a bunch of logic in my view or parsing all the potential records in my controller.
2012-07-26 20:09:42	ENQ	ericshell, use environments?
2012-07-26 20:09:56	ShawnMcCoo2	oneseventeen: there's multiple ways to do that, this one is the easiest
2012-07-26 20:10:16	ericshell	i dont. guess i could look into that
2012-07-26 20:10:16	oneseventeen	ShawnMcCoo2: which means it is the best! :)
2012-07-26 20:10:20	ShawnMcCoo2	creating a presenter is more powerful and more work, but you can bundle your presenter base class and continue using it
2012-07-26 20:10:24	Jakobud	ShawnMcCoo2: So it has to be a registered route? Can't access controller directly?  If I wanted to create a route/controller for cli-only cron jobs what is the best approach?
2012-07-26 20:10:25	ShawnMcCoo2	that reminds me
2012-07-26 20:10:28	oneseventeen	(actually for this project, easiest is where it's at)
2012-07-26 20:10:39	ShawnMcCoo2	Jakee`: i don't do route/controller for cli-only cron jobs
2012-07-26 20:10:41	ArtificialEX	does anyone use another wysiwyg with laravel?
2012-07-26 20:10:43	ShawnMcCoo2	i just rceate artisan tasks for cron jobs
2012-07-26 20:10:54	ShawnMcCoo2	php artisan messages:send
2012-07-26 20:10:56	ShawnMcCoo2	etc
2012-07-26 20:10:59	ShawnMcCoo2	they're a breeze to make
2012-07-26 20:11:07	ShawnMcCoo2	messages is the class, send is the method
2012-07-26 20:11:09	Jakobud	oh really
2012-07-26 20:11:12	ENQ	Jakobud, maybe use tasks?
2012-07-26 20:11:41	ArtificialEX	what is bundle:install vs bundle:publish?
2012-07-26 20:11:54	Jakobud	or in my controller I guess I could do if ( !Request::cli ) return Response::error('404');
2012-07-26 20:11:55	ShawnMcCoo2	bundle:install downloads a bundle from the laravel bundle repo

2012-07-26 20:12:05	ericshell	ah, environments r what i want. thx
2012-07-26 20:12:12	ShawnMcCoo2	bundle:publish takes all of the assets intended to be public in each of the bundles and publishes it into the public/bundles folder
2012-07-26 20:12:31	ArtificialEX	oh ok
2012-07-26 20:12:35	ShawnMcCoo2	in this way bundles can ship with things like css, js, etc files that can be automatically published into a predictable location, from which the bundle can reference those assets
2012-07-26 20:13:06	ArtificialEX	i wish I knew why this textarea has no markup :( the instructions were simple enough: https://github.com/ladea/Laravel-Markitup/blob/master/readme.md
2012-07-26 20:13:20	ArtificialEX	all the scripts are loading correctly with echo Asset::container('footer')->scripts(); ?>
2012-07-26 20:13:31	ArtificialEX	although i don't notice any styles loading with echo Asset::container('footer')->styles();
2012-07-26 20:15:26	oneseventeen	ShawnMcCoo2: any cool blog entries on presenters?
2012-07-26 20:15:49	ArtificialEX	i dont even get how this line of code tells where to get the styles from, or load too?
2012-07-26 20:15:50	ArtificialEX	Asset::container('footer')->scripts();
2012-07-26 20:15:54	ShawnMcCoo2	no sorry, i really do keep intending to write a presenter base class for laravel, but i was away for about a week and a half on vacation and i've been swamped

2012-07-27 11:41:01	Gent	That all said, I don't have much patience for people who only respond to yes men (or respect for that matter)
2012-07-27 11:41:08	ShawnMcCool	good will and all that

2012-07-27 11:42:02	@JasonLewis	daylerees: basically this still allows you to have Route::get('(:bundle)/register') and have it respond to simply localhost/register if you set the bundle to handle '/'
2012-07-27 11:42:20	@JasonLewis	which is good because people can still set the bundle to handle something else other then the root
2012-07-27 11:43:22	crynobone\mobile	JasonLewis: i wish URI::to() and Redirect::to() can handle bundle easier
2012-07-27 11:43:40	@JasonLewis	crynobone\mobile: I always thought the same thing..
2012-07-27 11:43:49	@JasonLewis	I had an issue opened for it yonks and yonks and yonks ago
2012-07-27 11:44:23	@JasonLewis	currently you have to name majority of your bundle routes if you want it to be completely flexible in terms of it's "handle" clause

2012-07-27 13:28:17	@daylerees	so many handy connectors on it
2012-07-27 13:28:20	ShawnMcCool	it's luxurious, but took me a long time to figure out how to use
2012-07-27 13:28:33	ShawnMcCool	and you basically can't own one without a color calibration tool

2012-07-27 13:29:24	@daylerees	resolution for me mate, i cant find another decent one above 1920
2012-07-27 13:29:34	@daylerees	apart from the thunderbolt, which is the same monitor

2012-07-27 13:30:31	tcql	we're in the middle of our conversion to laravel, and I'm in charge of 3 interns working on rebuilding a lot of our stuff, and it's crazy

2012-07-27 13:33:16	tcql	hehe yea, they're doing good
2012-07-27 13:33:27	tcql	there has been a lot to learn
2012-07-27 13:33:57	tcql	but my takeaway so far: Laravel = awesome. Bootstrap = awesome. Building a really AJAX heavy app = suck (but I already knew that)
2012-07-27 13:34:15	ShawnMcCool	it helps when you use one of the newer javascript frameworks designed to facilitate that specific task
2012-07-27 13:34:31	tcql	If it hadn't been for the time constraints and all of the other big changes I had to manage, I would have picked up a big JS framework
2012-07-27 13:35:06	tcql	I get the feeling we'll end up retooling some of our JS stuff in the future to be supported by a framework, but there's just not any way for that to happen right now

2012-07-27 14:43:57	k_89	daylerees, any idea why laravel doesn't allow for handling stuff like 404, 500 etc via exceptions?
2012-07-27 14:44:08	k_89	when t easily can
2012-07-27 14:44:23	k_89	or might i say also via exceptions

2012-07-27 14:45:15	k_89	crynobone, but they need to return stuff
2012-07-27 14:45:23	k_89	they can't really break the whole chain
2012-07-27 14:45:31	crynobone	return?
2012-07-27 14:45:39	crynobone	such as
2012-07-27 14:46:29	k_89	a sec
2012-07-27 14:46:54	crynobone	Event::fire() would return array, Event::first() and Event::until() would return single response

2012-07-27 14:48:00	crynobone	tplaner_: not so much actually
2012-07-27 14:48:09	tplaner_	crynobone: oh?
2012-07-27 14:48:29	k_89	firing an event just results in a closure being executed
2012-07-27 14:48:37	crynobone	most hardcore programmer i know doesn't really care

2012-07-27 14:48:54	k_89	crynobone, ^^
2012-07-27 14:49:09	crynobone	for 404, and 500 it does
2012-07-27 14:49:38	k_89	ahh .. i need to see how :P
2012-07-27 14:49:44	crynobone	and what good about it u can flush event and make sure ur own code become the final 404
2012-07-27 14:50:09	tplaner_	crynobone: well the larger issue is if you do a lot of front-end development, it is pretty difficult to do browser testing accurately on linux
2012-07-27 14:50:24	crynobone	u have to understand the different of Event::first('404') and Response::error('404');

2012-07-27 14:50:55	k_89	thats for designers to see
2012-07-27 14:51:23	k_89	i dont know too many who do both programming and designing(photoshop one, i bet every dev can pull up css and html anytime)

2012-07-27 14:52:48	crynobone	k_89 i'm guessing 404 exception because ur familiar with fuelphp
2012-07-27 14:53:38	k_89	yeah .. and it really allows better handling of 404's .. several exceptions extending the notfoundexception .. each being handled differenly
2012-07-27 14:53:46	crynobone	tplaner_: most designer (part time dev) wouldn't choose symfony
2012-07-27 14:54:12	k_89	true that ^^
2012-07-27 14:54:31	crynobone	i used to like exception, but it doesn't make much diff
2012-07-27 14:54:50	crynobone	cause 404 might not always be an exception, it might be an event to catch all
2012-07-27 14:55:08	JonoB	whats interesting is the high proportion of users using symfony for projects less than $10k

2012-07-27 15:35:15	davedx	crynobone - Oath1?
2012-07-27 15:35:16	nickstr	Not sure if you can do (:any) as the first parameter
2012-07-27 15:35:48	StratosGio	How would you build this URI: example.com/username/edit/password
2012-07-27 15:36:19	nickstr	example.com/user/username/edit/password
2012-07-27 15:36:33	StratosGio	username is variable always. The second parameter can be edit/delete and the third can be again 5-6 values
2012-07-27 15:36:36	nickstr	not sure if its the case btw
2012-07-27 15:36:42	crynobone	davedx: it harder to do
2012-07-27 15:36:52	crynobone	and more inconsistent
2012-07-27 15:36:58	crynobone	well so does oauth2
2012-07-27 15:37:09	StratosGio	My team has decided on /username instead of /user/username (it's harder I know)
2012-07-27 15:37:42	crynobone	i would prefer example.com/(me|account)/edit/password
2012-07-27 15:38:09	StratosGio	example.com/username also holds a profile page thought
2012-07-27 15:38:56	nickstr	Route::get('(:any)/(:any)', function() { echo 'works'; });
2012-07-27 15:38:56	davedx	crynobone - I had this discussion on Hackernews too. I implemented API clients for EC2 that used the HMAC request signing stuff, and sure it took a bit of head scratching to get it right but it wasn't worth scrapping the spec over. I still don't understand what the actual goals of OAuth 2 are really
2012-07-27 15:38:58	nickstr	works like a charm here
2012-07-27 15:39:21	nickstr	Are you getting any errors StratosGio
2012-07-27 15:39:42	davedx	there are so many options in OAuth 2 that I can't work out how I should be doing _anything_ in it :P
2012-07-27 15:39:43	crynobone	davedx: im most cases i see oauth1 access token is fixed per user (like forever)
2012-07-27 15:40:14	crynobone	ninjauth already implemented a oauth2 server setup

2012-07-27 15:45:27	nickstr	so if you have a get_detailpage
2012-07-27 15:45:31	nickstr	it should work aswell
2012-07-27 15:45:46	StratosGio	yes and then on the function I have the parameters
2012-07-27 15:46:04	StratosGio	only the first one is required, the other two optional

2012-07-27 16:15:54	Xsecrets	dsyme: what do you mean it works as intended? It doesn't do anything, but put a line in the extensions table. Basically I like to learn by taking apart existing code, and the problem with platform at this point is you don't have one single thing that works all the way through frontend and admin.
2012-07-27 16:15:55	dsyme	tplaner_: i think we'll announce 1.0 in a couple weeks. we feel its pretty solid.

2012-07-27 16:22:41	dsyme	Xsecrets: that shouldnt be the case. i'll have a run through. are working of a remote database? eventhen your next keystroke should not be prevented.

2012-07-27 16:25:03	Xsecrets	no localhost. There's two places you do that, one of them the next keystroke is not prevented one it is. both really slow things down with ajax calls and the experience is a bit different on different browsers. used chrome and firefox. You really should put a small delay in there couple hundred milliseconds to clean things up.
2012-07-27 16:25:29	Xsecrets	dsyme: is that extension available anywhere now?
2012-07-27 16:25:56	dsyme	xsecrets: ya, it needs to be updated to reflect the last weeks asset changes

2012-08-03 15:36:56	lie2815	sijdesign: cronjobs would be bad, this is for fluxbb, it's supposed to be easily installable ;)
2012-08-03 15:37:32	ShawnMcCool	random chance of sweepage is definitely the way to go
2012-08-03 15:37:44	ShawnMcCool	for example, on my blog i use disqus comments. they're javascript based
2012-08-03 15:37:54	ShawnMcCool	that means that google bots don't find them, which is bad
2012-08-03 15:38:27	Tobsn	TaylorOtwell, if i put in more validator checks into the validator.php - how do i related it back to the language file? like i put in a check for an array validate_array( $attribute, $value ) which has a static message but if i use for example validate_count( $attr, $val, $parameters ) how is the parameter passed onto the language file? so i can say "has to be :X count"
2012-08-03 15:38:39	ShawnMcCool	so on page load i check to see if that blog post's cache is expired, if it is i do an api call to disqus and pull down the comments so that i can display them in text form for the bots
2012-08-03 15:38:51	ShawnMcCool	if you can avoid cronjobs, absolutely do it
2012-08-03 15:38:56	ShawnMcCool	there are situations in which you just can't though
2012-08-03 15:38:57	@TaylorOtwell	Tobsn: yeah, i don't think you can pass custom parameters like that, unfortunately
2012-08-03 15:38:59	Tobsn	similar to the other languge examples like The :attribute has to be :max long" - wheres the :max coming from
2012-08-03 15:39:06	@TaylorOtwell	Tobsn: need a solution for that
2012-08-03 15:39:12	Tobsn	well but where is :max and :min coming from?
2012-08-03 15:39:18	sijdesign	https://www.varnish-cache.org/
2012-08-03 15:39:20	@TaylorOtwell	the validator handles that specially
2012-08-03 15:39:23	Tobsn	or :other
2012-08-03 15:39:24	sijdesign	any one try that ?
2012-08-03 15:39:45	ShawnMcCool	varnish is highly regarded, sijdesign. but i haven't used it personally
2012-08-03 15:39:46	@TaylorOtwell	Tobsn: they are all handled specifically for the rule

2012-08-03 15:49:07	Tobsn	soft delete? as in only on commit?
2012-08-03 15:49:14	sdeinum	like
2012-08-03 15:49:23	sdeinum	calling $user->delete(); would set a "deleted_at" column
2012-08-03 15:49:29	Tobsn	oh
2012-08-03 15:49:31	Tobsn	that would be
2012-08-03 15:49:31	sdeinum	calling User::all(); wouldn't include that deleted user

2012-08-03 15:49:57	Tobsn	but thats something you can easy build yourself
2012-08-03 15:50:08	xsbeats|mobile	Would it replace delete or be a separate method?

2012-08-03 15:50:16	Jakobud	So I was messing with file upload validation last night and in the case that a file isn't uploaded due to being larger than PHP max_upload/max_post, it makes the 'image', 'mime' and 'max' validation rules look like they are throwing false positives because the uploaded file (which never actually gets uploaded) has no mime-type and no file size. Has anyone experienced this? It seems like the
2012-08-03 15:50:16	Jakobud	validation should check to see if a file was actually successfully uploaded as well, or something. Not sure what the best solution would be.
2012-08-03 15:50:27	sdeinum	xsbeats|mobile: yes it replaces the default delete
2012-08-03 15:50:29	Tobsn	->delete() and ->remove() maybe
2012-08-03 15:50:36	Tobsn	whereas remove "removes" it from the result
2012-08-03 15:50:37	xsbeats|mobile	Oh I wouldn't like that
2012-08-03 15:50:44	Tobsn	that could be included in find/get

2012-08-03 15:51:38	sdeinum	or it SHOULD
2012-08-03 15:51:48	@TaylorOtwell	_porque: because you spin through pivots and do $pivot->save()

2012-08-03 15:51:52	sdeinum	yeah it will

2012-08-03 15:54:05	sdeinum	if you want soft delete, you probably do want it to replace delete though

2012-08-03 16:30:19	adambecker	@crynobone thanks, i'm struggling to figure out how to listen for that event
2012-08-03 16:30:27	AnimeCYC	Jakobud: required|uplaoded
2012-08-03 16:30:51	Jakobud	why does it have to be required?
2012-08-03 16:31:14	Tobsn	cause you want it to validate the input
2012-08-03 16:31:19	crynobone	Event::listener('eloquent.saving: User', function ($model) { $model->active = 1 }));
2012-08-03 16:31:25	crynobone	just an example
2012-08-03 16:31:26	Jakobud	custom validation rules only work on required inputs?
2012-08-03 16:31:44	Tobsn	i think yeah
2012-08-03 16:31:53	Tobsn	kinda silly thinking about it
2012-08-03 16:31:56	Jakobud	:-/ hmmmm
2012-08-03 16:32:02	Jakobud	that doesnt sound right
2012-08-03 16:32:07	crynobone	Jakobud: it would be ignore if value is null or empty
2012-08-03 16:32:11	AnimeCYC	Jakobud: You need something there for a custom validation rule to run through
2012-08-03 16:32:32	AnimeCYC	Jakobud: I believe required will ensure that and it should pass to the custom rule.
2012-08-03 16:32:33	crynobone	required mean it has to have a at least a value

2012-08-03 16:33:18	Jakobud	but there are like all kinds of other validation rules that work independently of 'required', like 'max:', 'integer', etc
2012-08-03 16:33:58	Jakobud	it's weird that a custom validation rules doesn't work unless 'require' is there as well
2012-08-03 16:34:12	adambecker	@crynobone thanks a bunch

2012-08-03 16:34:43	crynobone	'email' => 'email' would pass if no email is passed
2012-08-03 16:35:08	Jakobud	But I am passing a value. In this example case, it's just a Form::file() field called 'image'. I pick my file, hit submit, and the validation passes even though my custom validation rule clearly returns false (on purpose, just for testing).

2012-08-03 16:36:20	Jakobud	but when you do
2012-08-03 16:36:23	Jakobud	you want the validation rule to run
2012-08-03 16:36:28	Jakobud	and in my example it's not
2012-08-03 16:36:35	Jakobud	see my point?
2012-08-03 16:36:39	crynobone	or should the validation work when i add the file

2012-08-03 16:47:36	Jakobud	okay so it looks like custom validation rules are running fine on non-file inputs. But to make them run on file inputs, the rule must also be "|required" for the custom validation to run.
2012-08-03 16:47:51	Jakobud	which is not right

2012-08-13 09:39:36	leekudos	is it possible to use a sub-dir structure within bundles? i.e. bundle API, with sub-dirs called v1. Inside v1 is the normal bundle setup. Still trying to think how best to setup my API.
2012-08-13 09:40:01	ytsejam	nickstr: main page and default page  ...are they different? can you tell me a little about what do you mean by main page?I think we have a misunderstanding here. I ask where do I use this ajax. There must a template/main page. Where to use the page in Base_Controller.php or Routes.php?
2012-08-13 09:41:38	nickstr	You have your main route, were you load your homepage and include your css/javascript/images that kind of stuff. On that page your have your navigation, that navigation loads pages into a content div, these loaded pages take over the styles from the main page (your homepage in this case)
2012-08-13 09:41:57	ShawnMcCool	i make my api's as separate applications from everything that digests them
2012-08-13 09:42:01	ShawnMcCool	then, i put them in the application folder
2012-08-13 09:42:44	leekudos	ShawnMcCool: that was my orignal intention but then thought that the main site/app will be the main consumer of the API. Wouldnt it be more efficient (less HTTP calls) to call upon the API internally?

2012-08-13 09:44:02	ShawnMcCool	i haven't written an api that is used in that way, yet
2012-08-13 09:44:33	ShawnMcCool	we had an international package shipment system that had a website using the API, and it was vital to not be dipping into the same repository for code
2012-08-13 09:44:34	Tobsn	whats he doing?
2012-08-13 09:44:41	ShawnMcCool	he has an api, and a website that digests it
2012-08-13 09:44:51	Tobsn	oh we had that topic before
2012-08-13 09:45:01	Tobsn	build classes that are accessable through laravel and through another wrapper
2012-08-13 09:45:13	Tobsn	so you can itnernally call it as usual but also by a api wrapper

2012-08-13 09:45:29	ShawnMcCool	so, you're putting teh application and the api into the same installation, right?
2012-08-13 09:45:30	leekudos	would you use bundles for this purpose?
2012-08-13 09:45:38	Tobsn	yeah i would use bundles
2012-08-13 09:45:50	Tobsn	and just different routes or different environments
2012-08-13 09:45:58	Tobsn	ShawnMcCool, yeah
2012-08-13 09:46:09	Tobsn	its one thing, from one side its the website, from the other its an api
2012-08-13 09:46:20	Tobsn	you basially have two controllers for the same model
2012-08-13 09:46:24	Tobsn	kinda like that
2012-08-13 09:46:45	leekudos	so you wouldnt use the REST urls as such internally?
2012-08-13 09:46:53	Tobsn	obviously depends on where you want to split it into a base and where you want to split the view
2012-08-13 09:46:57	Tobsn	no
2012-08-13 09:47:09	Tobsn	you do everything internally as usual
2012-08-13 09:47:19	Tobsn	but if its an API you split it off as raw calls
2012-08-13 09:47:21	Tobsn	or something
2012-08-13 09:47:36	Tobsn	you def. do not call http:// on your own server
2012-08-13 09:48:06	Tobsn	class API_Controller {} vs. Class Base_Controller {}
2012-08-13 09:48:11	Tobsn	which both use the same base
2012-08-13 09:48:15	Tobsn	hmm hard to explain
2012-08-13 09:48:18	leekudos	yea well that was what was bugging me, especially on pages with multiple sets of data. Adding 3-4 further HTTP calls seems daft.
2012-08-13 09:48:32	Tobsn	yeah thats silly, you dont do that
2012-08-13 09:48:33	leekudos	hard to follow :)
2012-08-13 09:48:33	ShawnMcCool	it sounds like you're creating a library that hosts your actual API

2012-08-13 09:48:50	ShawnMcCool	then you have external routes that call that library and return data for the external api
2012-08-13 09:48:52	Tobsn	you just make them available to both calls, internally and api requests
2012-08-13 09:48:55	ShawnMcCool	and interally, you can call against that library
2012-08-13 09:48:59	Tobsn	yep
2012-08-13 09:48:59	ShawnMcCool	and it's always executing the same code, one way or another

2012-08-13 09:50:00	leekudos	would you split before the controller or after?

2012-08-13 09:53:25	ShawnMcCool	it's possible to also do sort of a.. Rails responds_to thing
2012-08-13 09:53:50	leekudos	thanks, sorry I dont know rails at all.
2012-08-13 09:54:14	ShawnMcCool	the idea being that maybe you have umm..
2012-08-13 09:54:25	ShawnMcCool	as a bad example
2012-08-13 09:54:26	ShawnMcCool	http://myapp.com/users
2012-08-13 09:54:28	rsmarshall	hey all
2012-08-13 09:54:29	ShawnMcCool	and http://myapp.com/users.json
2012-08-13 09:54:29	leekudos	Im just wondering how to structure this whole thing now. Bundles or libs? Models and controllers or just classes
2012-08-13 09:54:49	ShawnMcCool	ok, so in your API bundle, you'd have models and a library
2012-08-13 09:54:57	ShawnMcCool	then in your application bundle you'd have controllers
2012-08-13 09:55:09	ShawnMcCool	and in your application you'd interact with the MyAPI library as if it's your models
2012-08-13 09:55:17	ShawnMcCool	morning rsmarshall
2012-08-13 09:55:39	ShawnMcCool	and in your API's routing you'd interact with your MyAPI library as if it's your models
2012-08-13 09:55:47	ShawnMcCool	because the MyAPI library IS the API
2012-08-13 09:56:11	rsmarshall	reading dayles book and in the bit about routes with closures it mentions setting up a named route and then having another route redirect to it. If you have the named route profile can you just link to that in your view without having to point it to a route that redirects to the named?
2012-08-13 09:56:30	rsmarshall	so if i had /profile it would just be picked straight up by the named route?
2012-08-13 09:56:35	ShawnMcCool	rsmarshall: if you're routing to anonymous functions you'll want to use named routes for reverse-routing
2012-08-13 09:56:37	rsmarshall	nooob question i know :)
2012-08-13 09:56:47	ShawnMcCool	if you're routing to controllers you'll want to use action based reverse-routing
2012-08-13 09:56:57	ShawnMcCool	so, if you have the controller users and the action index (users@index)
2012-08-13 09:57:10	ShawnMcCool	you'd generate links as {{ HTML::link_to_action('users@index', 'View all of the users') }}
2012-08-13 09:57:29	ShawnMcCool	if you're using named routes you'd do {{ HTML::link_to_route('routename', 'View all of the users') }}
2012-08-13 09:57:42	ShawnMcCool	in this way, if you change the route configuration, all of the links across the site change to accomodate it
2012-08-13 09:58:01	ShawnMcCool	so, your routes.php becomes a glorious abstraction between your application code and the URL of the site
2012-08-13 09:58:03	rsmarshall	yeah i just mean if i have a route Route::get('users/profile', array('as', 'profile',.... can i just use link_to_route('profile') ?
2012-08-13 09:58:12	ShawnMcCool	yea, and probably want text in the link, too
2012-08-13 09:58:26	ShawnMcCool	but yea
2012-08-13 09:58:30	FrenkyNet	morning
2012-08-13 09:58:33	ShawnMcCool	morning
2012-08-13 09:58:52	rsmarshall	ok, just wondered as in dayle's book he uses an example where another route does return Redirect::to_route('profile'). cheers, make sense
2012-08-13 09:58:56	leekudos	ShawnMcCool: thank you. general quesiton but how would you decide whether the call was external and how would that call be handled? Perhaps a seperate API controller which interacts with the MyAPI lib.
2012-08-13 09:59:40	ShawnMcCool	one way would be to have a subdomain api.mysite.com
2012-08-13 09:59:58	ShawnMcCool	another would be mysite.com/api
2012-08-13 10:00:10	ShawnMcCool	if you're designing an API, i recommend this http://vimeo.com/17785736
2012-08-13 10:00:12	rsmarshall	i go with the subdomain route for things like that
2012-08-13 10:00:13	ShawnMcCool	it's only 15 minutes long
2012-08-13 10:00:21	rsmarshall	a vhost on the same server as your app is ok for the api
2012-08-13 10:00:23	leekudos	seen it thanks! :)
2012-08-13 10:00:36	rsmarshall	then call it the same way a 3rd party would :)
2012-08-13 10:00:38	ShawnMcCool	also, consider checking out apiary.io
2012-08-13 10:00:39	ShawnMcCool	i love it
2012-08-13 10:01:02	ShawnMcCool	you can design your api in pseudo code
2012-08-13 10:01:05	ShawnMcCool	and then query against it
2012-08-13 10:01:25	leekudos	subdomains are taken so second option is preferable for me. So any call with /api/ as 2nd segment is external.
2012-08-13 10:01:26	ShawnMcCool	in this way you can design it, write your application or whatever, adjust the pseudo code schema until your application has everything it needs, THEN code your API
2012-08-13 10:01:28	rsmarshall	ah nice, i'll look at that when i can
2012-08-13 10:01:34	leekudos	that looks cool thanks
2012-08-13 10:02:05	ShawnMcCool	and in teh end

2012-08-13 10:23:19	MichMich	nickstr: Yeah, I do have a TM backup on e network drive. But since my machine has a secundairy HDD with more then enough space, It would make live easier If I have a sparsebundle avalable to get some important files back after a clean install... :)
2012-08-13 10:23:40	MichMich	_druu: thanks
2012-08-13 10:25:58	nickstr	True MichMich
2012-08-13 10:26:17	nickstr	i would love to do a clean install
2012-08-13 10:26:22	nickstr	no time :(
2012-08-13 10:27:28	MichMich	just figured I wont do it either... to mucht to restore. Don't have time for thet either.
2012-08-13 10:27:34	nickstr	yeah
2012-08-13 10:27:36	nickstr	same here :p
2012-08-13 10:29:33	mrwbsn	stupid me.. i forget to configure my server config
2012-08-13 10:30:25	leekudos	Tobsn: re the API disussion earlier - how would you split up the api classes and how would you call them? perhaps a central API front controller which calls the classes from within the lib dir?
2012-08-13 10:31:14	nickstr	Oh, it watched the hunger games yesterday: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0xmh6rCEq1qbnggp.jpg
2012-08-13 10:31:30	rsmarshall	or maybe an API controller that all the others extend?
2012-08-13 10:31:41	rsmarshall	so API then Users extends API
2012-08-13 10:32:28	rsmarshall	When I wrote an aPI with codeigniter that's what I did leekudos
2012-08-13 10:32:44	leekudos	thanks rsmarshall
2012-08-13 10:32:47	MichMich	nickstr: +1
2012-08-13 10:32:56	<--	MichMich (~michmich@5357DA56.cm-6-8d.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has left #laravel
2012-08-13 10:33:14	rsmarshall	you can have all your aPI auth in the main api class and anything central, then your others have access to it all :)
2012-08-13 10:33:28	leekudos	I have loads of categories within the site. Just thinking how to handle internal calls
2012-08-13 10:33:36	leekudos	users, support, orders etc
2012-08-13 10:34:03	leekudos	ok yea, so an API base class
2012-08-13 10:34:09	rsmarshall	yeah
2012-08-13 10:34:17	rsmarshall	then a users, support, orders controller
2012-08-13 10:34:22	rsmarshall	well one for each
2012-08-13 10:36:24	-->	MichMich (~MichMich@5357DA56.cm-6-8d.dynamic.ziggo.nl) has joined #laravel
2012-08-13 10:37:11	leekudos	ok its starting to piece together. If 1st segment of url is "api" then its an external call and the api bundle routing will ensure that only the data (JSON) is returned. Any other url structure and its a normal page visit. The page controller will call the Api::User class which is in the api bundle/lib dir. They can be namespaced and aliased simply to User etc.
2012-08-13 10:38:02	rsmarshall	nice :)
2012-08-13 10:38:08	leekudos	mind you, the API should always return the JSON data regardless. Dont really want to encode and decode every time. Have to detect what format depending on whether internal or ext.
2012-08-13 10:38:58	leekudos	interal = php obj or array. unless ajax then keep as json. getting messy :(
2012-08-13 10:39:00	rsmarshall	when i did it i just had the subdomain setup and regardless of internal or external calls they all went to api.app.com
2012-08-13 10:39:35	rsmarshall	yeah might be best just running jason_decode on internal or external to keep the same method for all
2012-08-13 10:39:35	leekudos	but Im trying to avoid unnecessary HTTP calls you see. I want the site to consume the API internally.
2012-08-13 10:39:45	rsmarshall	it's up to you though, you know your app and situation :)
2012-08-13 10:39:59	leekudos	youd think so! :)
2012-08-13 10:40:09	rsmarshall	hehe, you do just takes some working out
2012-08-13 10:40:18	leekudos	I guess maintaining the format across the board would be tidier.
2012-08-13 10:40:25	rsmarshall	just makes things easier
2012-08-13 10:40:51	rsmarshall	a slight bit of overhead for a uniform way of working is worth it
2012-08-13 10:41:25	leekudos	yea well the overhead avoided by keeping the API calls internal will more than compensate the overhead of a few decode calls
2012-08-13 10:41:35	rsmarshall	true
2012-08-13 10:41:57	leekudos	and ofc if the api was external the data return format would be standardised anyway
2012-08-13 10:42:02	rsmarshall	yup
2012-08-13 10:42:06	leekudos	so yea - good call :)
2012-08-13 10:42:15	Tobsn	wow... so our recruiting companies mail server is rejecting my emails to them
2012-08-13 10:42:18	Tobsn	because it thinks its spam
2012-08-13 10:42:25	Tobsn	so i sent it to her as link
2012-08-13 10:42:34	Tobsn	which she says she cant open because of internal policies
2012-08-13 10:42:43	rsmarshall	depends on how large your going to get also. if your api is a vhost it makes scaling easier i think as you can just shift it to another server anytime you need to.
2012-08-13 10:42:44	Tobsn	then i send her the txt file over skype
2012-08-13 10:42:49	Tobsn	which she cant accept due to internal policies
2012-08-13 10:42:49	rsmarshall	but again it all depends on the situation
2012-08-13 10:42:54	rsmarshall	ouch tobsn lol
2012-08-13 10:43:03	Tobsn	then she asks me to attach the email to an email
2012-08-13 10:43:10	Tobsn	which i already told her does not matter and ive already tried
2012-08-13 10:43:22	Tobsn	then she says she has no problems with emails today and sends me a test mail
2012-08-13 10:43:29	rsmarshall	dropbox?
2012-08-13 10:43:32	Tobsn	yes
2012-08-13 10:43:33	Tobsn	i tried that
2012-08-13 10:43:35	Tobsn	she cant open links

2012-08-13 10:43:42	Tobsn	against company policy

2012-08-13 10:44:12	leekudos	lol!
2012-08-13 10:44:24	Tobsn	im very close to tell her im going to find another company if she does not take the txt file
2012-08-13 10:44:35	Tobsn	this is redicilious
2012-08-13 10:44:42	nickstr	Fax it

2012-08-13 12:59:35	ShawnMcCool	is this a yahoo sports stream, papi?
2012-08-13 12:59:41	ShawnMcCool	i use to import those for a site i worked on

2012-08-13 12:59:44	papi83dm	ea sports
2012-08-13 12:59:53	ShawnMcCool	ah
2012-08-13 13:00:44	papi83dm	I was thinking of querying all the games before, in one query and then compare them with the xml, that way I do one query instead of 16
2012-08-13 13:01:22	nickstr	could you paste an example of the .xml file you're getting?
2012-08-13 13:02:58	papi83dm	sure
2012-08-13 13:03:07	papi83dm	the gameid is unique
2012-08-13 13:03:20	papi83dm	but in the url I have to pass the seasonid and franchiseid

2012-08-13 13:09:26	leekudos	ShawnMcCool: got a base setup for the API as we discussed earlier with Tobsn. The app calls API\Users::get() to get user details, API\Users::get(123) to get a given user etc. If external API access then i want to use proper RESTful approach using HTTP verbs. But this doesnt correspond well to the above examples. Any ideas?
2012-08-13 13:09:59	Tobsn	of course it does
2012-08-13 13:10:01	Tobsn	just route it
2012-08-13 13:10:19	Tobsn	jsut have two environments
2012-08-13 13:10:22	leekudos	yea I thought that but routing every call will create a large routes.php
2012-08-13 13:10:23	Tobsn	one for www. one for api.
2012-08-13 13:10:35	ShawnMcCool	but also, you seem to be making direct model calls
2012-08-13 13:10:37	Tobsn	and split the routes.php into each env
2012-08-13 13:10:41	ShawnMcCool	in my mind you want an API library that makes the model calls
2012-08-13 13:10:51	ShawnMcCool	and the website and the restful web api would both call against that library
2012-08-13 13:10:54	leekudos	no those are calls to the lib files which then "talk" to the models
2012-08-13 13:10:55	ShawnMcCool	not against models
2012-08-13 13:11:00	ShawnMcCool	oh, cool
2012-08-13 13:11:15	leekudos	they are namespaced for ease
2012-08-13 13:11:35	Tobsn	man, i wish fucking online ads would use browser language and not IP... im always getting polish ads. completely useless
2012-08-13 13:11:50	Tobsn	not only are they annoying, no they are complete giberish to me now
2012-08-13 13:11:51	Tobsn	great.
2012-08-13 13:12:03	leekudos	so Route::get(/users, API\Users::get())
2012-08-13 13:12:05	ShawnMcCool	i get duthc ads, which is good because advertisements use first-grade level vocabulary
2012-08-13 13:12:05	@daylerees	polish ads, like mr muscle, and pledge?

2012-08-13 13:42:30	ShawnMcCool	otherwise you'll have serious performance issues
2012-08-13 13:42:45	ShawnMcCool	you could reasonably index most any field that is in a where clause

2012-08-13 15:10:10	davzie	Without them we have literally no online presense for this site.
2012-08-13 15:10:15	davzie	It's brand new so won't naturally rank.
2012-08-13 15:10:35	davzie	Fortunately we're just securing some local places we can create pop-up shops to sell through

2012-08-13 15:15:36	nickstr	haha, i have one of those clients
2012-08-13 15:15:42	nickstr	"we want to add hidden text"

2012-08-13 15:16:46	Zoxxa	When adding an asset, the second param is to be relative to the public dir, will Laravel detect if I provide a full url hotlinking a google asset file instead?

2012-08-13 16:03:22	ShawnMcCool	i'll be writing it specifically for my client
2012-08-13 16:03:27	ShawnMcCool	then refactoring it for a more general purpose bundle

2012-08-13 16:31:15	@JasonLewis	Ah, my guess is it's the router that's killing it. You've defined your routes as Route::get('your/route/') with the trailing slash?
2012-08-13 16:31:26	davzie	Actually for us at the moment it is broken completely, we're fucked naturally and are paying through the nose for clickcs
2012-08-13 16:31:36	Feld0	Some pages of my site actually are a "directory" - like the listing of users, or a listing of albums.

2012-08-13 16:34:01	@JasonLewis	Feld0: Then I'd say Laravel just isn't meant to add trailing slashes.. you could look into the router and see what's causing the issue. Most likely there's a trim() in there somewhere.
2012-08-13 16:35:21	Feld0	JasonLewis: I suppose I could live without the trailing slashes - it would save a character, anyway. I'd rather not modify Laravel's core files if they're stripping it somewhere.
2012-08-13 16:35:35	dresfedz	the Request strips the slashes so the Router will never match a Route for the URI

2012-08-13 16:49:08	@JasonLewis	that way you avoid what davzie just said
2012-08-13 16:49:08	davzie	That way you have the unique identifier that JesseObrien is talking about linking to that artist, the visual name of the artist AND the name of the song.

2012-08-13 16:49:40	davzie	Yeah or the track id either way its not human readable but as long as there is a human readable string at the end that matches it will be fine right?
2012-08-13 16:49:47	davzie	ec30 .htaccess?
2012-08-13 16:49:48	Feld0	Well, the only reason I wanted to put the username into the track URL was to improve branding for the artist. Kind of like how Bandcamp gives you http://myawesomeband.bandcamp.com/track/my-song.

2012-08-13 16:54:59	Feld0	It's not only artists that will be on this site. It will be integrated to share accounts with a large forum, and the non-artist members will be active on the music site as commenters, followers, etc. as well. They are currently allowed to change their names on the forum, and it would be strange to them if they couldn't change their names on the music site as well.
2012-08-13 16:55:49	JesseObrien	Feld0: you could have a "display" name, and a "user name" if you wanted
2012-08-13 16:55:55	Feld0	That's why I'm leaning towards avoiding putting the artist and track into the same URL.

2012-08-13 17:11:33	Feld0	Current plan for URL's is to use http://pony.fm/tracks/name-of-song.542 as the canonical URL for a song, with http://pony.fm/t542 as a "shortlink" that 301's to the full URL, where 542 is the track ID number. Would that work well (in particular, I'm wondering if the track ID could be better placed)? I've more or less decided to avoid using the artist name in the track URL.
2012-08-13 17:12:29	Feld0	The other option I considered was just using the "shortlink" above as the canonical URL, but having the track name in the URL looks nicer for artists and gives users an idea of where the link goes.

2012-08-13 17:40:44	machuga	_porque: indeed
2012-08-13 17:40:48	machuga	What kind of ruby book though
2012-08-13 17:41:04	machuga	I personally think that Eloquent Ruby will be your best way to go
2012-08-13 17:41:05	ShawnMcCool	this is the one i got http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1344876056&sr=8-1&keywords=the+ruby+programming+language

2012-08-13 17:41:31	machuga	and he's almost always in #ror and #ruby I think

2012-08-13 17:42:06	guynamedkeith	is there a bundle for pretty pritning var_dump or print_r?
2012-08-13 17:42:09	machuga	_porque: as long as you find a ruby 1.9 based book - no
2012-08-13 17:42:12	_porque	I'm afraid of buying old books and get things wrong
2012-08-13 17:42:13	guynamedkeith	*printing
2012-08-13 17:42:16	machuga	1.8 has been EOL'd

2012-08-13 17:43:44	machuga	Langs don't change too much ;)
2012-08-13 17:43:55	machuga	that being said, I'd still recommend Eloquent Ruby
2012-08-13 17:44:05	machuga	It's up-to-date on the Ruby 1.9.x changes
2012-08-13 17:44:15	machuga	and the ruby 1.9 book is a good thorough walkthrough of everything as well
2012-08-13 17:44:27	_porque	is that the name? I can't find it on http://search.oreilly.com/
2012-08-13 17:44:36	machuga	Eloquent isn't on oreilly

2012-08-13 17:52:21	machuga	Actually the one thing I forgot to point out earlier this week, ShawnMcCool JesseObrien, is that the Laravel community is roughly similar to Ruby's
2012-08-13 17:52:47	MichMich	machuga: naahh... laravel's community is better..;)
2012-08-13 17:52:48	ShawnMcCool	they talk more than they work?
2012-08-13 17:52:58	MichMich	more love, more sexytime
2012-08-13 17:52:58	machuga	The majority of us are genuinely involved in helping other people learn, being kind to others, and educating on relevant topics
2012-08-13 17:53:06	JesseObrien	machuga: i had a terrible experience with the rails community ~2 years ago, it really put me off ruby, even though rails is seperate

2012-08-13 17:53:23	JesseObrien	was basically told to fuck off and stop asking about things
2012-08-13 17:53:32	machuga	Ruby communities are much more focused around helping people and learning

2012-08-13 17:53:37	JesseObrien	good good
2012-08-13 17:53:41	Kindari	JesseObrien: very similar to #php in general. I don't get why these channels exist if not to help others.
2012-08-13 17:53:51	JesseObrien	Kindari: i'll never understand it
2012-08-13 17:53:55	lolhii_	#php has actually helped me before
2012-08-13 17:54:00	machuga	I like that the  two share philosophies
2012-08-13 17:54:10	JesseObrien	people sit in IRC rooms, then heckle and ahrass others for asking about their product/lang/service
2012-08-13 17:54:18	JesseObrien	harass*
2012-08-13 17:54:29	Kindari	The most helpful person I've found in #php is that Viper guy. Think Viper-7 or something.
2012-08-13 17:54:37	machuga	you mean like the cakephp troll that comes through here sometimes?
2012-08-13 17:54:39	lolhii_	Does anyone use an IRC client

2012-08-13 17:55:40	machuga	he was legitimately rather entertaining

2012-08-13 17:56:19	JesseObrien	yeah gent is more of a proper troll, he's subtle at times
2012-08-13 17:56:22	machuga	whereas wiredesignz may actually be trying to make people quit programming

2012-08-13 17:56:53	ShawnMcCool	there was this guy named toopay or something
2012-08-13 17:56:56	ShawnMcCool	who was an ok guy

2012-08-13 17:56:58	lolhii_	I remember mirc from '05
2012-08-13 17:57:00	ShawnMcCool	he just always had a troll vibe going on
2012-08-13 17:57:14	sdeinum	Gent has the most rediculous opinions just for the sake of having them
2012-08-13 17:57:22	ShawnMcCool	lots of socially awkward types in our industry
2012-08-13 17:57:22	JesseObrien	lolhii_: Xchat2 is probably your best bet on windows
2012-08-13 17:57:22	machuga	ya, toopay genuinely cared about stuff but would jsut take things way too far
2012-08-13 17:57:36	ShawnMcCool	yea, i'm cool with toopay
2012-08-13 17:57:38	sdeinum	i asked him why he had to be an asshat in this channel and the TL;DR was "well people like linus are very opintionated so i am too"
2012-08-13 17:57:42	ShawnMcCool	although i'm sure he isn't very cool with me, haha
2012-08-13 17:57:53	JesseObrien	lolhii_: if you're on a mac http://colloquy.info/
2012-08-13 17:57:53	machuga	lol really?  He seemed to like you

2012-08-13 17:58:09	ShawnMcCool	yea, i dunno. i have no ill will
2012-08-13 17:58:14	machuga	he and I were cool with each other because Iw as generally his translator

2012-08-13 17:58:36	ShawnMcCool	but
2012-08-13 17:58:45	ShawnMcCool	he saw a problem and he fixed it
2012-08-13 17:58:51	machuga	The codebase was pretty solid and benchmarked way better than PHPAR
2012-08-13 17:58:53	Kindari	JesseObrien: re: Gent, he is a proper troll, isnt he. Hes trollish to an extremely annoying level but at the same time redeems himself (some of the time).
2012-08-13 17:59:03	machuga	though that's a given for many reasons
2012-08-13 17:59:14	machuga	Kindari: that was very accurate lol
2012-08-13 17:59:18	JesseObrien	Kindari: yeah sometimes he's legit helpful, then he dives off the deep end lol

2012-08-13 18:05:56	lolhii	Having 5 projects, I want to use Laravel for each. Should I copy the Laravel framework for each project? Or create a folder for each project, controllers/proj1

2012-08-13 18:06:39	ShawnMcCool	who knows if you're going to have to break your projects apart
2012-08-13 18:06:51	JesseObrien	yeah i would say probably individual installs, but everyone defines "project" differently
2012-08-13 18:06:52	ShawnMcCool	better to just be able to have them in 5 separate git repos and 5 separate laravel installations
2012-08-13 18:06:59	ShawnMcCool	yo phil
2012-08-13 18:07:00	Kindari	lolhii: The projects are different, so make them seperate apps in my opinion. But, parts of those projects may use the same code. That code should be placed in "bundles" which is how laravel address re-uability of code, which you can share between the prohects.

For some reason, after moving my laravel site to a new server, doing http://domain.com/whm gets me a Laravel 404 error page due to a Route::any('(:any)', function());, but on the older server it did not. Any ideas what setting was in the previous server that allowed that?
2012-08-13 18:23:40	ShawnMcCool	same version php and apache?

2012-08-13 19:29:51	machuga	To a degree - it's largely based off of Sprockets
2012-08-13 19:29:57	vFragosop	is there anyway to show query values with DB::profile() or am i stuck with "WHERE id = ?"
2012-08-13 19:30:11	ShawnMcCool	i agree it's not much automatable
2012-08-13 19:30:23	machuga	comment annotations to load up what files and/or trees need to be included in compilation for many of the assets
2012-08-13 19:30:33	@TaylorOtwell	vFragosop: you can also handle the query event… Event::listen('laravel.query', function($sql, $bindings) {});
2012-08-13 19:31:18	vFragosop	hmm, I'll see how this works :)
2012-08-13 19:31:38	machuga	And then kind of invert what the bundle:publish task does - instead the compiler would traverse all of the assets and pull them into their respective locations and/or minify them on the way in
2012-08-13 19:31:45	@TaylorOtwell	yeah
2012-08-13 19:32:00	@TaylorOtwell	i want to look into it more
2012-08-13 19:32:38	machuga	Sprockets adds some additional extras that the pipeline handles as well, along with multiple type handlers.  so document.coffee.erb would compile ERB, then compile the coffeescript, then output the JS form
2012-08-13 19:32:56	@TaylorOtwell	yeah that's pretty cool

2012-08-13 19:48:54	papi83dm	is that the only way to append those extra keys to each row?
2012-08-13 19:49:22	machuga	papi83dm: since you have custom stuff there, I wouldn't try to optimize much more
2012-08-13 19:49:29	machuga	you don't really need the array_merge though
2012-08-13 19:50:17	papi83dm	what would I use?
2012-08-13 19:50:26	machuga	$row['stats']['franchise_id'] = $this->conference_id;
2012-08-13 19:51:25	machuga	your row is a temp var anyway, may as well take advantage of it :p
2012-08-13 19:51:50	papi83dm	i'm still parsing thu each rows
2012-08-13 19:51:53	machuga	yup
2012-08-13 19:51:59	machuga	You're doing custom work - you're going to have to
2012-08-13 19:52:24	papi83dm	thanks
2012-08-13 19:52:57	papi83dm	i was hoping there was an easier way to append to each row without having to go threw each one

2012-08-13 19:53:24	machuga	I don't see you using $row inside of the array_merge
2012-08-13 19:54:36	papi83dm	I only want $row[stats]

2012-08-14 09:03:03	@JasonLewis	apart from being composer based, *lots* easier to test, plus a lot of overhauling, L4 is still L3 in its roots.

2012-08-18 15:29:22	AzizLight	or is there a way to check if a record is a new record from a view (form)?
2012-08-18 15:30:06	Taftse	AzizLight, i would do those checks in the controller
2012-08-18 15:31:46	noherczeg	if on my host I can only put my site to a public_html folder how do I make it ignore the /public/ segment in the url? Is a .htaccess rewrite enough?
2012-08-18 15:31:55	AzizLight	Taftse: I can't, I'm gonna show you some code in a bit, give a sec and you'll see ;)
2012-08-18 15:31:55	noherczeg	or I should contact the adminisztrators?
2012-08-18 15:32:43	Taftse	noherczeg, i think htaccess should be enough
2012-08-18 15:33:09	Taftse	Warning i am still very much a laravel noob
2012-08-18 15:33:14	noherczeg	me too :D
2012-08-18 15:33:40	noherczeg	we have one htaccess in public too, so i'm not really shure though
2012-08-18 15:33:54	noherczeg	how does it respond to a previous rewrite
2012-08-18 15:34:35	Meroje	noherczeg can you put some files outside public_html ?
2012-08-18 15:35:03	Meroje	you only need the content of public on your host's public_html
2012-08-18 15:35:03	noherczeg	never ever tried
2012-08-18 15:35:09	noherczeg	but shouldn't
2012-08-18 15:35:11	AzizLight	Taftse: http://paste.laravel.com/3pb << THat's what I want to do, can't do this from the controller as far as I know
2012-08-18 15:35:36	Meroje	noherczeg all of the files the browser shouldn't have access to can be placed outside the document root
2012-08-18 15:36:25	noherczeg	okay, but never tried it with laravel
2012-08-18 15:36:28	Meroje	only index.php images, styles must be placed in it
2012-08-18 15:36:56	Meroje	you can rename public to public_html and upload as is on your ftp
2012-08-18 15:37:05	Meroje	replacing the existing public_html
2012-08-18 15:37:07	noherczeg	is this tested?
2012-08-18 15:37:14	noherczeg	or just theory? :)
2012-08-18 15:37:31	Meroje	tested, larval don't rely on this folder name
2012-08-18 15:37:44	Meroje	laravel*
2012-08-18 15:37:47	noherczeg	steveweb_: here's your answer then :)
2012-08-18 15:40:42	noherczeg	Meroje: thanks was usefull :)

2012-08-18 15:47:23	xsbeats	AzizLight are you simply trying to share a single view with editing a record and creating a record?

2012-08-18 15:47:57	AzizLight	xsbeats: basically yeah
2012-08-18 15:48:32	xsbeats	do you have a Base_Controller?

2012-08-18 15:49:04	xsbeats	well actually i don't know your whole set up, so i'll just tell you what you need to do
2012-08-18 15:49:39	xsbeats	you need to pass a variable that indicates you are creating or editing (ie $create = true, or $edit = true)
2012-08-18 15:49:50	xsbeats	then pass that to your view and check for its existence in your view
2012-08-18 15:49:58	AzizLight	xsbeats: I though of that but that's an ugly solution :P
2012-08-18 15:50:26	AzizLight	xsbeats: anyway thanks for helping ;)
2012-08-18 15:50:29	Curlified	Hi, newcomer here - anyone know why I'm getting "array_diff_key(): Argument #1 is not an array" when attempting Auth::attempt()?
2012-08-18 15:50:44	Guardian666	Check if User is null in your controller, if so then do $user = new User; Then your view will work without if statements etc.
2012-08-18 15:51:30	Guardian666	Its the same way kohana works, return an empty user instead of a null variable
2012-08-18 15:51:54	AzizLight	Guardian666: no because I don't want to display a textfield for email if the user exists I want to display the email as text instead
2012-08-18 15:52:15	Guardian666	ah ok

2012-08-18 15:53:22	xsbeats	AzizLight the way i do it for mine it kind of makes it not such an ugly solution, but it involves hacking the Base_Controller a bit
2012-08-18 15:53:43	AzizLight	xsbeats: shoot
2012-08-18 15:55:27	xsbeats	this is my base http://paste.laravel.com/3pm

2012-08-18 15:59:19	xsbeats	so create is by default set to false, unless explicitly changed to true
2012-08-18 15:59:26	xsbeats	then i just check for the value of create in my view
2012-08-18 15:59:58	xsbeats	but that base controller also lets me just set variables in the view by doing $this->someVariable = value
2012-08-18 16:02:09	AzizLight	I have this code for now: http://paste.laravel.com/3ps but for some reason the user variable is not available in the view...

2012-08-18 16:08:35	xsbeats	yes, but are you literally just trying to show $user
2012-08-18 16:08:41	xsbeats	or are you doing like $user->property
