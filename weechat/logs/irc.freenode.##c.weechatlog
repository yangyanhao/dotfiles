2012-08-03 11:31:53	phao	the next may be a spear, arrow or single dash, you don't know, so you should go to the state where you read 1dash

2012-08-03 11:41:57	roxlu_	(Im mixing C/C++) and I've got a main.cpp which includes some C headers (in extern "C" {} blocks). But as soon as I include <vector> I get errors like error: `::mktime' has not been declared

2012-08-03 11:42:10	roxlu_	I think it's because ctime defines size_t which is used by vector.
2012-08-03 11:42:15	roxlu_	Does someone knows how to solve this?

2012-08-03 12:28:17	Zhivago	It is an n-way tree.
2012-08-03 12:28:36	Zhivago	So from the empty string it branches three ways -- 't', 'A', and 'i'.

2012-08-03 12:41:52	snhmib	dardevelin: if all you want is storage you can just treat keys as bunch of bytes

2012-08-03 13:31:54	dardevelin	In computer and machine-based telecommunications terminology, a character is a unit of information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme, grapheme-like unit, or symbol, such as in an alphabet or syllabary in the written form of a natural language. -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)
2012-08-03 13:32:05	Zhivago	dardevelin: Which isn't what a code-point is.
2012-08-03 13:32:18	Zhivago	dardevelin: That's what a combining character sequence is, in unicode.

2012-08-03 13:35:25	Zhivago	That's because characters are essentially arbitrary, for a given use-case.
2012-08-03 13:35:30	dardevelin	you seem to still fail to understand that i only care on what is the "element" so "d" or 'd' i don't care, i care that is the element
2012-08-03 13:36:03	dardevelin	which individually represents a grapheme or whatever . that has the visual representation

2012-08-03 13:37:35	dardevelin	the idea (and since the beginning i have pointed this out) is that Ok, unicode does it's best at getting this representations correct in the screen
2012-08-03 13:38:00	dardevelin	i want to manipulate the smaller" group of a representable element to obtain permutations
2012-08-03 13:38:09	Zhivago	dardevelin: Sure, and it does that with _sequences_ of code-points.
2012-08-03 13:38:19	Zhivago	dardevelin: Permuting code-points makes no sense at all.
2012-08-03 13:38:32	dardevelin	now a sequence implies start_middle_end
2012-08-03 13:38:36	Zhivago	dardevelin: How do you expect to permute an accent?
2012-08-03 13:38:55	dardevelin	i do not care about the accent except if alone
2012-08-03 13:39:05	dardevelin	if á is written
2012-08-03 13:39:08	Zhivago	But the accent may be a separate code-point ...
2012-08-03 13:39:10	dardevelin	i want to permute á
2012-08-03 13:39:14	Cr4x3	Hi everyone. Just a question about some terminology... How would you call an array declaration like this : int tab[10] as opposed to int *tab; and then malloc() ? I'm using a framework which doesn't handle the first type of declaration, but I cannot find any suitable name to describe it... Is it like a static declaration, while the other is a dynamic one ? Thanks, I don't know if my question is clear
2012-08-03 13:39:24	Zhivago	But it will them form an illegal sequence ...
2012-08-03 13:39:41	Zhivago	You can't compose code-points freely.
2012-08-03 13:40:04	dardevelin	look variable character width
2012-08-03 13:40:05	Zhivago	cr: An array definition as opposed to a pointer definition initialized by a call to malloc ...
2012-08-03 13:40:07	dardevelin	á
2012-08-03 13:40:15	LeoNerd	Cr4x3: The first is called automatic, though in practice many people might call it "allocated on the stack", or somesuch.
2012-08-03 13:40:17	dardevelin	á != a
2012-08-03 13:40:33	hrnt	dardevelin: á = ´ + a
2012-08-03 13:40:33	I-Love-Boobies	Why? Arrays can be static.
2012-08-03 13:40:34	dardevelin	so, if all block that makes á is moved what's the deal ?
2012-08-03 13:40:50	Zhivago	dardevelin: Because you are wrong.
2012-08-03 13:40:57	hrnt	sure, you can normalize the unicode string, but there are combinations you cannot normalize into a single code point

2012-08-13 08:35:02	Chris	It starts off stating the obvious, so it's not an advanced doc.

2012-08-13 08:35:43	Chris	A book that is advanced and goes beyond the GDB documentation might make sense though.
2012-08-13 08:35:53	Chris	But a beginner book is just going to be an inferior subset of it.

2012-08-13 12:59:41	talin	hello. i just did exercise 3-2 in K&R, but i think my answer is horrible. http://codepad.org/2oO36KC3 ... is there a better way to do lines 12, 13 and 16, 17? and then there's line 30... i have no idea how long the "after" line will be in the end, so i multiply the length by 3...
2012-08-13 12:59:54	talin	the whole thing feels very dirty
2012-08-13 13:00:33	talin	the task is to take a sequence of chars containing \n and \t and copy it to another array whilst converting \n and \t such that they won't be escaped
2012-08-13 13:01:00	talin	oh, and you have to use a switch(). the point of the exercise is to learn how switch works, i think
2012-08-13 13:01:04	Tuplanolla	I was expecting to see a disaster, but the solution is actually reasonable.
2012-08-13 13:01:48	Tuplanolla	I'd however get rid of MAXLEN as it's unnecessary.

2012-08-13 13:02:52	Tuplanolla	The codomain of the function can be bound.
2012-08-13 13:03:51	talin	it seems i should loop until MAXLEN - 1 instead of MAXLEN. on the output on the webpage, there's a 4 at the end
2012-08-13 13:04:06	Tuplanolla	The lower bound is the input length and the upper bound is twice that.
2012-08-13 13:04:20	talin	Tuplanolla: aah... good point

2012-08-13 17:14:05	JoeQuery	Regex might be too expensive for what you want (and truthfully I've never worked with regex using C, so using PCRE might be more trouble than its worth), but "Home " + /(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\/\d{1,2}/ should work.

2012-08-13 17:14:34	Stormhawk	s5s: The IP isn't really the tricky bit; you can read them in as integers separated by a dot

2012-08-13 17:15:23	JoeQuery	Perhaps some sample data would make things easier?

2012-08-13 18:58:43	Chris	Mocrasmis: the point of -S is so that you can look at the assembly output.
2012-08-13 18:59:01	cousteau	you can do that with objdump or something like that

2012-08-13 19:05:22	cousteau	although maybe if you compile with -Os then printf might stay printf so that there are no more function definitions

2012-08-13 19:05:50	Chris	tested, it doesn't
2012-08-13 19:06:22	cousteau	well, puts is rather big on some platforms...
2012-08-13 19:06:53	cousteau	for some weird reason, printf uses like 30 KB in an embedded processor I use
2012-08-13 19:07:01	cousteau	and don't know about puts, but it's not small
2012-08-13 19:07:11	Chris	printf is complicated with all the format shit
2012-08-13 19:07:14	Chris	puts should be trivial
2012-08-13 19:07:22	cousteau	however they made their own trimmed down version of printf.  It sucks, but it's only 1K

2012-08-13 20:51:00	Tuplanolla	Yes, sporkbox.
2012-08-13 20:51:02	Tordek	yes; any other function called after reverse may overwrite the place where out was
2012-08-13 20:51:06	sporkbox	Ah.
2012-08-13 20:51:06	Tuplanolla	You have two (or three) options.
2012-08-13 20:51:08	JoeQuery	Potentially, it may not be immediate or obviously broken, which is the scary part.
2012-08-13 20:51:42	Tuplanolla	Either require the caller to allocate the space,
2012-08-13 20:51:56	Tuplanolla	use malloc to allocate the space on the heap and require the caller to free it later or
2012-08-13 20:52:22	Tuplanolla	have a static value you write to and return a pointer to it.
2012-08-13 20:52:27	sporkbox	Well, I'm working on a K&R2 exercise, so I'm sure there are parts of the stdlib I can use to make this easier but I haven't gotten that far yet.
2012-08-13 20:52:36	Tordek	Tuplanolla: also, replace in-place
2012-08-13 20:53:00	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: A 'static value'?
2012-08-13 20:53:12	Tordek	sporkbox: static variables?
2012-08-13 20:53:39	sporkbox	That's new to me (in C anyway). still on chapter one in the K&R >_>
2012-08-13 20:54:10	Tordek	if you have a function like foo(){ static bar; }, it's similar to having a global variable bar;, but its name is only known to foo

2012-08-13 20:54:16	FUZxxl	Hello!
2012-08-13 20:54:28	Tordek	in a broad and not totally correct sense
2012-08-13 20:54:41	sporkbox	Tordek: Does that prevent it from being pushed from the stack before it's called again?
2012-08-13 20:54:49	Tordek	yes
2012-08-13 20:54:50	FUZxxl	gcc accepts the syntax a?:b as a synonym for a?a:b. Is that standartized syntax? If not, which compilers support it?
2012-08-13 20:54:54	Tuplanolla	It's "always" on the stack, sporkbox.
2012-08-13 20:55:14	sporkbox	But it's still mutable like most variables?
2012-08-13 20:55:28	Tordek	yes
2012-08-13 20:55:31	Tordek	now...
2012-08-13 20:55:32	sporkbox	e.g. like defining a variable outside of any function.
2012-08-13 20:55:42	Tuplanolla	I think in-place mangling, which I forgot to mention, is the best option here, sporkbox.
2012-08-13 20:55:43	Tordek	given what you've been taught so far
2012-08-13 20:55:46	Chris	FUZxxl: I only know gcc supports it.
2012-08-13 20:55:52	Chris	FUZxxl: it's not standard
2012-08-13 20:56:12	Tordek	you should choose, either: modify the string you've been passed
2012-08-13 20:56:36	FUZxxl	Chris: Thank you!
2012-08-13 20:56:37	Chris	FUZxxl: clang also supports it, because clang is trying to be compatible with gcc
2012-08-13 20:56:56	Tordek	or: change reverse() to int reverse(char *out, char *in, int len);
2012-08-13 20:57:12	iKlsR	how do i suppress warnings
2012-08-13 20:57:29	Tordek	and ask for an array where you'll write your stuff as the first param, Tuplanolla
2012-08-13 20:57:33	Chris	iKlsR: you don't want to do that until you've learned C properly.
2012-08-13 20:57:36	Tordek	er, sporkbox , I mean
2012-08-13 20:57:47	sporkbox	Tordek: Hmm.
2012-08-13 20:57:48	Chris	iKlsR: fix the code, don't suppress the warning.
2012-08-13 20:57:52	iKlsR	Chris: i have 4 years of programming knowledge
2012-08-13 20:57:58	sporkbox	Tordek: Which do you consider cleaner?
2012-08-13 20:57:58	Tuplanolla	There's one more solution I forgot to mention, sporkbox and Tordek.
2012-08-13 20:58:07	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: Okay. I'm interested.
2012-08-13 20:58:08	iKlsR	im working btw, but im just starting to compile from the cmdline
2012-08-13 20:58:13	Chris	iKlsR: what warning do you think you want to suppress?
2012-08-13 20:58:23	iKlsR	simple deprecated stuff.. i know what im doing
2012-08-13 20:58:27	iKlsR	etc
2012-08-13 20:58:29	Tuplanolla	If the codomain is enumerable you can have a global lookup table of all the possible solutions you you return a pointer to.
2012-08-13 20:58:30	Chris	iKlsR: I doubt it.
2012-08-13 20:58:39	iKlsR	ok nvm
2012-08-13 20:58:51	Tordek	haha, check out them fancy words!
2012-08-13 20:58:53	Tuplanolla	Most likely not in this case, but it works with things like key codes.
2012-08-13 20:58:54	Tordek	;p

2012-08-13 21:00:12	sporkbox	Chris: Don't they stick to < 80 char lines, and put braces on separate lines?
2012-08-13 21:00:23	beaky	but 8 spaces per indent seems too much :(
2012-08-13 21:00:29	sporkbox	4 ftw

2012-08-13 21:18:29	I-Love-Boobies	Yes, the debugger had a cyan window. Other windows were cyan too (e.g., Watches).

2012-08-13 21:19:24	Chris	more like 18
2012-08-13 21:20:12	I-Love-Boobies	Heh. I was 2 or 3 back then.

2012-08-13 21:22:04	I-Love-Boobies	I didn't know much C back when I used it; I was more into Pascal. But they had a similar IDE.
2012-08-13 21:22:07	pragma-	every single screenshot of Borland Turbo C that I've found in google images has crappy code written in it :p
2012-08-13 21:22:31	atrigent	sporkbox: you don't need the &
2012-08-13 21:22:40	Chris	I started with Pascal in ~1986 then moved to C in ~1989
2012-08-13 21:22:42	sporkbox	atrigent: oh?
2012-08-13 21:22:43	pragma-	and almost ALL of them have getch()
2012-08-13 21:22:43	I-Love-Boobies	I don't know whether they had this for C, but BP came with a library called Turbo Vision, which was a thing for building UI's like the IDE they had.
2012-08-13 21:23:12	atrigent	you also don't need a separate foo variable
2012-08-13 21:23:30	Chris	sporkbox: char x[40]; char *a = x; -- this is short for char *a = &x[0]; which is what you want, the address of the first element.
2012-08-13 21:23:48	pragma-	I had VB-Dos so I could compile QBasic programs -- it was pretty neat for making Windows-like UIs in DOS text-only with ASCII art.
2012-08-13 21:23:53	Tuplanolla	What does in = out do there, sporkbox?
2012-08-13 21:24:11	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: It was supposed to copy the reversed output to the input string.
2012-08-13 21:24:20	sporkbox	I tested it and it doesn't reverse >_>

2012-08-13 21:25:05	Tuplanolla	out being the location of the first element of the local array and in being the local copy of the location of the buffer.
2012-08-13 21:25:06	I-Love-Boobies	Turbo Vision is where I learnt OOP from.
2012-08-13 21:25:17	Chris	Same.
2012-08-13 21:25:26	Chris	With Borland Pascal then later Borland C++
2012-08-13 21:25:38	pragma-	vbdos could have overlapping windows
2012-08-13 21:25:51	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: So in order to copy them over I'd need to use a loop to assign one to the other, char by char?

2012-08-13 21:26:14	I-Love-Boobies	The results look very similar, in fact.
2012-08-13 21:26:23	Tuplanolla	You could also do the manipulation directly in the buffer.

2012-08-13 21:26:44	tromp_	does any1 here have access to the official grammar for C ?

2012-08-13 21:26:45	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: Wouldn't I need an intermediary variable?
2012-08-13 21:26:47	pragma-	heh
2012-08-13 21:26:52	Tuplanolla	Nope.
2012-08-13 21:26:53	pragma-	I was just looking at that
2012-08-13 21:27:20	Chris	tromp_: there is no "official grammar", there are official standards that include a description of the grammar.
2012-08-13 21:27:29	tromp_	i wonder why assignment is allowed in then part of conditional expression, but not in else part
2012-08-13 21:27:40	tromp_	and how that is reflected in the grammar
2012-08-13 21:27:53	Chris	tromp_: it is allowed in the else part, if you mean the ?: operator.
2012-08-13 21:27:54	Tuplanolla	You could also not use a buffer and do the manipulation directly in the input (and destroy it in the process), sporkbox.
2012-08-13 21:28:15	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: I don't understand how I would do that with just the buffer and avoid destroying the data I haven't get gotten to.
2012-08-13 21:28:25	tromp_	i can say !i--?i=b:0
2012-08-13 21:28:27	sporkbox	haven't yet*
2012-08-13 21:28:42	tromp_	but   i can't say i--?0:i=b;
2012-08-13 21:28:50	Chris	tromp_: because ou need (i=b)
2012-08-13 21:29:00	tromp_	so there's a difference!
2012-08-13 21:29:04	Chris	otherwise it's trying to assign b to the result of your first expression
2012-08-13 21:29:09	tromp_	you don't need the parentheses in then part
2012-08-13 21:29:12	pragma-	google images search for "vbdos" has vastly unrelated images thrown in, how strange.
2012-08-13 21:29:19	Chris	that's because there's not a precedence problem there
2012-08-13 21:29:33	Chris	a?b:c=d is the same as (a?b:c)=d
2012-08-13 21:29:40	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: If I start at the end of the string and start assigning at the beginning, I'll be overwriting the beginning of the line with the end.
2012-08-13 21:29:41	Chris	so you need to do a?b:(c=d)
2012-08-13 21:29:56	Tuplanolla	Think outside the box, sporkbox. :)
2012-08-13 21:30:03	Chris	tromp_: in any case, see http://iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard

2012-08-13 21:30:12	sporkbox	Tuplanolla: I thought of a reverse loop a moment ago...
2012-08-13 21:30:31	Tuplanolla	What if you only ever swapped elements, sporkbox?
2012-08-13 21:30:34	kesselhaus_	sporkbox: swap them ...t = a; a = b; b = t;
2012-08-13 21:30:52	sporkbox	Eh?

2012-08-18 16:04:01	soryy708	savio - 'name' currently points to trash, and by using gets() you try to write to some weird memory adress
2012-08-18 16:04:15	savio	ohhh my mistek
2012-08-18 16:04:16	savio	malloc
2012-08-18 16:04:21	savio	will do it
2012-08-18 16:04:26	soryy708	savio - Either use an array of characters, or do a char* name = malloc(strlen("Hello World"))
2012-08-18 16:04:36	savio	wait i try

2012-08-18 16:04:44	soryy708	savio - Well actually no, do a malloc(sizeof(char))
2012-08-18 16:04:49	soryy708	youlysses - Hello! I know you.

2012-08-18 16:05:26	savio	soryy708, wait but that will allocate only one char place
2012-08-18 16:05:33	-->	rald (~rald@112.203.60.71) has joined ##c
2012-08-18 16:05:52	soryy708	savio - Yeah. A char* is a pointer to a char, though.

2012-08-18 16:06:08	soryy708	savio - I still think the least messy way of doing it is by using an array.
2012-08-18 16:06:33	savio	soryy708, i knw but i tricking with pointer
2012-08-18 16:07:07	akali	soryy708 : I have to initialize 400 numbers, so it's kinda messy, if it's just óne big line
2012-08-18 16:07:07	savio	using malloc sentace you post that will allocate only one character space not whole string
2012-08-18 16:07:08	soryy708	savio - Try allocating enough space for a character, see what happens. If not, allocate enough for a string.
2012-08-18 16:07:23	<--	rald (~rald@112.203.60.71) has quit (Client Quit)
2012-08-18 16:07:30	soryy708	savio Try allocating 512 characters then.
2012-08-18 16:07:34	-->	rald (~rald@112.203.60.71) has joined ##c
2012-08-18 16:07:39	soryy708	akali - Okay, so do a loop.
2012-08-18 16:08:20	savio	soryy708, one more
2012-08-18 16:08:40	soryy708	savio - What?
2012-08-18 16:08:50	savio	if a declare pointer to string and i pass it to printf suppose
2012-08-18 16:09:03	akali	soryy708: the numbers are "random" not total random, but they don't follow any kind of pattern
2012-08-18 16:09:11	savio	like printf("%s",name);  if name is pointer
2012-08-18 16:09:19	soryy708	savio - It's not a pointer to a string, it's a pointer to a character (a beggining of a string)
2012-08-18 16:09:27	savio	then what is passed to printf
2012-08-18 16:09:30	soryy708	akali - Generate them with rand()
2012-08-18 16:10:02	soryy708	savio - The adress of the beggining of the string, pointed to by name, is passed to printf().

2012-08-18 16:11:05	akali	soryy708 the numbers are fixed, I can't change them, if they where total random, I was not gonna sit and write 400 number manually :)
